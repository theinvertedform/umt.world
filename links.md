title: About the Author
description: "My life story, work and academic experience; psychological profiles, political profiles, and philosophical worldview; data representing my tastes and media consumption."
abstract: "I am a communist writer, philosopher, and critic. My research into visual culture has focused on the modern era, with an interest in periodizing the contemporary. I am interested in media institutions, digital life, and philosophies of technology. My reading in philosophy has always been oriented around Karl Marx, and tends German overall. The Lonely Dane and the Crazy German are the philosophers who have most touched my heart. These studies are the basis of my literary practise, which brings together many different disciplines to create a panoramic view of the Contemporary. I include *the use of computers* as an element of my creative practise, meaning web and typographic design, as well as the software that comprises one's digital writing environment (for more on this, see the [*About the Website*](/about) page). Some of my questions include: how does media change, and what is its history? What is the relation between media and technology? What is the origin of the digital? How does digital life stand in relation to historical precedents? What is the relation between the modes of production, and the aesthetic and social lives of a given period?"

# [Fiction and memoir](#fiction-and-memoir)

On this website, I have published excerpts from my Diary, which I describe as an "autofictional practise of narrative construction." I have written many stories that are taken from my life, with characters based on people I know. What kind of relation does any of this have to the Truth? The goal of fiction is to represent the Truth, and therefore it ought to involve an element of the author's experience. However, we cannot seriously make an equation between a literary effect and a real person.

# [Biographical Summary](#biographical-summary)

The author was born on November 17, 1990 at 457 Main Street, in Toronto, Ontario, and given the name Uriah Marc Todoroff. My maternal grandfather was descended from a long line of French colonists; my grandmother was Franco-Manitoban. On my father's side, my grandmother was a Scottish immigrant who I met only once. My grandfather, a Bulgarian immigrant, died long before I was born.

![The author circa 1995.](assets/images/me/babyme.jpg)

At fourteen, I moved to Montréal. I lived with my aunt and started attending a small, ["alternative" high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_High_School). I moved between schools in Montréal and Toronto, before eventually dropping out altogether circa 2007, age 16.

I moved around a lot, tried many different types of work. After I read *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* and *On the Road* back-to-back, I convinced myself that the "mountain-top" Zarathustra spoke about would involve a hobo sojourn. I was on the road for a year.

I didn't find myself. The days were driftless and I was constantly on the outside. No home: nowhere to enter into; all I saw were faces. It's exhausting. I needed to relax. I needed to feel like I actually lived somewhere. It was Montréal, the only place I had ever felt settled. I needed to return home and make it my home.

At some point in the first half of 2016, I applied to Concordia for an undergraduate degree in philosophy. I took another month off to go to Halifax. Hitching home, I was stopped off at this dairy farm when I got the news that I had been accepted.

# [Personality](#personality)

Gass referred to the writing life as "a life in the chair." A desk chair, or an electric chair?

## [Astrological chart](#astrological-chart)

![Natal chart.](assets/images/chart.gif)

Scorpio, rising Sagittarius. Full chart and reading forthcoming. Mars dominates my chart, but I have always preferred Pluto as a personal icon. I like astrology as a symbolic language, and a future project will be to analyze statistical correlations in certain readings. I like the materialism of astrological metaphysics...of course, I should admit as well that it has always been a useful tool for processing emotions. I have not studied astrophysics, I know barely anything about the history of astrology, and I am not even familiar with the signs, except for in a superficial way. Although my knowledge is superficial, my interest is genuine.

## [Personality Tests](#personality-tests)


* [YourMorals.org Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2](/assets/documents/mfq2-2022.pdf) (2022)
* [Relationship Survey](/assets/documents/relationship-survey-2022.pdf) (2022)
* 16Personalities: "Advocate" (INFJ-T)
*Advocates are quiet visionaries, often serving as inspiring and tireless idealists. These rare types are open-minded and imaginative, applying care and creativity.*

My username is theinvertedform. The inverted form and the inverted world both recur throughout Hegel and Marx. I like "theinvertedform," especially as it's set.
