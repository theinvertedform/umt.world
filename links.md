title: About the Author
description: Links that describe me around the Internet.
abstract: I am a writer and philosopher with a practise in critical thought and speculative realist fiction, exploring questions around culture, art, and society. I have trained in the research and visual analysis across cinema, photography, and the fine arts. At the same time, my training in philosophy has given me experience in the depth, rigour, and clarity of thought expressed in writing. An ongoing encounter with contemporary culture is the material basis of my critical practise, whose scope brings a philosophical worldview into form. This process of articulation was originally begun, and continues through my literary works, which offer my own aesthetic representation of the present. These representations emphasize the interplay between social condition and character, using concepts as the speculative basis to explore settings across literary genre. My writing attempts to express what is at stake in the structuring concerns common to our society, using narrative to explore the dramatic depths of a scenario and thereby exposing the political reality of the present. Experiments with the form of criticism and non-fiction writing, informed in the first instance by an encounter with the real, are the basis of a practise that retains a consistent voice and purpose across different topics, genres, and lengths. Narrative craft is the organizing principle of a practise that attempts to realize the conclusions of philosophical investigations in literature.

# Formation

## Astrological chart

Scorpio, rising Sagittarius. Full chart forthcoming. Although Mars dominates my chart, I have always preferred Pluto as a personal icon. I like astrology as a symbolic language; I like the materialism of astrological metaphysics, and it has always been a useful tool for processing emotions. I have not studied astrophysics, I know barely anything about the history of astrology, and I am not even familiar with the signs, except for in a superficial way (it's on my [to-do list](/about#to-do). My interest in astrology has an element of irony, and my knowledge is superficial, but it is a sincere interest.

# Things I Use

## Technical setup

* Thinkpad X1 Carbon (5th gen). This is my main computer. I have a desktop that I use as a media server and as a backup. The laptop is starting to show its age. I yearn for a fully-modded Thinkpad X220.
* Gentoo Linux since roughly Summer 2020. Arch Linux for years before then. A brief spell of using Windows on a laptop, preceded by not having one. I first started experimenting with Linux around the age of 16, using Slackware and Ubuntu for a number of years.
* Vim. It's very important to me, and a crucial part of how I understand new media.
* I have a generic 60% mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches. I like it and I like the tactility, but I hope to one day upgrade to either a vintage IBM Model M, or its continuation, the Mini-M.
* I run a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/dwm) of the [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) window manager, alongside a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/st) of the [simple/suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org)
