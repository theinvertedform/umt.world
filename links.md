title: About the Author
description: "My life story, work and academic experience; psychological profiles, political profiles, and philosophical worldview; data representing my tastes and media consumption."
abstract: "I am a communist writer, philosopher, and critic of contemporary culture. My area of historical interest is the modern leading into the contemporary; my object of study is visual culture. My research is focused on creating an historical overview of the interplay between mass media and the avant-garde, relying on philosophies of technology, media theory, and historical materialism. Some of my questions include: how does media change, and what is its history? What is the relation between media and technology? What is the origin of the digital? How does digital life stand in relation to historical precedents? What is the relation between the modes of production, and the aesthetic and social lives of a given period? I work in the traditions associated with German Idealism, Marxism, Frankfurt School critical theory, and value-form theory."

# [Fiction and memoir](#fiction-and-memoir)

The abstract of this page describes my academic interests. The introduction paints a picture of my personal style and the things I like. Below you will find a biographical summary, work experience, surveys on my politics, personality, and philosophical worldview. There are astrological readings, data on my listening, viewing, and reading habits; a rundown of my lifestyle, and many photos.

None of this can represent a person. Fiction is an idealized representation of reality: it is not reality itself. There is nothing to be found in this place other than

# [Biographical Summary](#biographical-summary)

The author was born on November 17, 1990 at 457 Main Street, in Toronto, Ontario, and given the name Uriah Marc Todoroff. My maternal grandfather was descended from a long line of French colonists; my grandmother was Franco-Manitoban. On my father's side, my grandmother was a Scottish immigrant who I met only once. My grandfather, a Bulgarian immigrant named Petar Todorov, died long before I was born.

At fourteen, I moved to Montréal. I lived with my aunt and started attending a small, ["alternative" high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_High_School). I moved between schools in Montréal and Toronto, before eventually dropping out altogether circa 2007, age 16.

![The author circa 2010.](assets/images/me/pixxx\ 005.jpg)

I moved around several more times, tried my hand at several different types of work---even starting my own business in Toronto. I became restless after reading *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* and *On the Road* back-to-back, and became convinced that the "mountain-top" Zarathustra spoke about would involve a Kerouac-style hobo sojourn. I spent about six months travelling around the United States, two months in Ecuador and Peru, and then another six months in British Columbia.

There were days when everything was so easy that I felt as though I had been transported back into another era. I carried the same struggles, and after so much time moving around---to Toronto, then on the road---I decided that I needed to return home. I needed to return to Montréal.

At some point in the first half of 2016, I applied to Concordia in the Philosophy program. I took another month off to go to Halifax. I was stopped off at this dairy farm when I got the news that I had been accepted.

# [Personality](#personality)

Gass referred to the writing life as "a life in the chair." A desk chair, or an electric chair?

## [Astrological chart](#astrological-chart)

![Natal chart.](assets/images/chart.gif)

Scorpio, rising Sagittarius. Full chart and reading forthcoming. Mars dominates my chart, but I have always preferred Pluto as a personal icon. I like astrology as a symbolic language, and a future project will be to analyze statistical correlations in certain readings. I like the materialism of astrological metaphysics...of course, I should admit as well that it has always been a useful tool for processing emotions. I have not studied astrophysics, I know barely anything about the history of astrology, and I am not even familiar with the signs, except for in a superficial way. Although my knowledge is superficial, my interest is genuine.

## [Personality Tests](#personality-tests)


* [YourMorals.org Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2](/assets/documents/mfq2-2022.pdf) (2022)
* [Relationship Survey](/assets/documents/relationship-survey-2022.pdf) (2022)
* 16Personalities: "Advocate" (INFJ-T)
*Advocates are quiet visionaries, often serving as inspiring and tireless idealists. These rare types are open-minded and imaginative, applying care and creativity.*

!["I am a part of all living things!"](/assets/images/robo.jpg)

Here are links to the social media accounts that I am active on. I can be reached through direct message on any of these platforms, and I encourage you to give me a follow and send me a message. If you prefer, you can [email me](mailto:um.todoroff@gmail.com) or [leave anonymous feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckpSDCKX3uNollW7CJmZF5V3zumIljoDAWsf8ftB6HTNJIKw/viewform). I read everything and it brings me great validation to hear from people. I respond when I can---I think we are all familiar with the obstacle of maintaining our inboxes.

My current username is theinvertedform, a phrase that emerged to me out of my first reading of [*Capital*](/marx). Somewhere in the section on commodity fetishism, the words "inverted form" appear in close proximity. It wasn't until years later, when reading [*The Phenomenology of Spirit*](/hegel), that I came across the related phrase "the inverted world." I like "theinvertedform," especially as it's typeset. It's a bit emo; "the inverted world" perhaps even more so. Needless to say, I am claiming both of these as my titles, the latter for an as-yet unrealized project.

The URL for this website is simply my initials (Uriah Marc Todoroff). I chose the .world TLD as a reference to the concept from Hegel, and because I conceived of this website as being an entry-point into my world.
