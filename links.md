title: About the Author
description: "My entire life story: everywhere I ever worked, every school I went to; every friend, lover, and enemy; a tour of my studio and working methods; psychological profiles, political profiles, and philosophical worldview tests; data representing my tastes and media consumption."
abstract: "I am a communist writer, philosopher, and critic of contemporary culture. My area of historical interest is the modern leading into the contemporary; my object of study is visual culture. My research is focused on creating an historical overview of the interplay between mass media and the avant-garde, relying on philosophies of technology, media theory, and historical materialism. Some of my questions include: how does media change, and what is its history? What is the relation between media and technology? What is the origin of the digital? How does digital life stand in relation to precedents in modern culture? What is the relation between the modes of production, and the aesthetic and social lives of a given period? My theoretical research is in the fields of Marxism, German Idealism, Frankfurt School critical theory, and communist theory."

How do you get to know a man? Through his choice of self-presentation? What constitutes an introduction? In the abstract of this page, I include my practitioner's statement. It is intended to describe how I see myself---what I want to be as an artist and a scholar. Some of the sections on this page deal with my tastes in certain domains; some of them attempt to quantify my personality and worldview; still others describe my tools and workflows. However, the most important parts, in my view, are the biographical overview and the photos that I will endeavour to add.

# Biographical summary

## 1990--2004

I was born on November 17, 1990 and given the name Uriah Marc Todoroff. Marc is for my mother's brother, who died in Saskatchewan around 13 years old. He's buried there next to his parents, Norman and Georgette Raymond. That's where my mother grew up with her three sisters and three (now two) brothers. Dad grew up around Gravenhurst, Ontario. Now it's cottage country, where those of his six sisters who still live are retired. They're all over six feet tall, and "big-boned," like a family of giants. His dad came from Bulgaria and died before I came on the scene. I was told that he used to own a restaurant. I met his mother once, maybe around 3 or 4 years of age. All I remember is her blind hands on my face. Old Isabella, who came here from Scotland. Dad died April 5, 2005. Mom gave my sister and three brothers French names. I was the only one she allowed to give a first name to, and he rewarded us both by choosing a rare name. Knowing that dad was a metalhead, I assume that it is taken from the band Uriah Heep (named after a character in a Dickens novel. My dad read a lot, but I don't know if Dickens was his speed).

I grew up in Toronto. It says East York on my birth certificate, but that place-name has since been amalgamated into the GTA. We moved a few times throughout my childhood, each time further east, eventually settling in Scarborough. I used to steal cigarettes from my dad, smoke cigarette butts, shoplift candy, skip school a lot, start fires, run around in parking garages, throw rocks at cars from overpasses, run around with gangs of kids getting into fights with other gangs of kids, breaking every window in the school, terrorizing small business owners, throwing eggs at buses, playing Nicky Nicky Nine Doors, stealing the bulbs from Christmas lights and smashing them. I also used to read a lot, and write poetry and little stories and draw and listen to music.

## 2005--2009

I wasn't in school, I wasn't really doing anything when dad started dying. This is the first major dark period in my life. I was highly emotional---used to write poetry like mad, then throw the book against the wall and burst into tears. I took the option of moving to Montréal. Anything was better than nothing. I lived with my aunt Lorraine and started attending an "alternative" high school that she had found. I started off quite poorly socialized, but eventually fell in with another gang in the tiny school. Typical teenage behaviour of drinking, smoking, listening to music, shoplifting, doing whatever drugs I could get my hands on, climbing things, saying stupid things, vandalizing things, falling in love, not having sex, yearning to be a writer but not practicing enough. I kept it up for a few years---moved between a few high schools in Montréal before going back to Toronto to try the classic big high school experience. I made it less than a year before I finally dropped out to work at a 24-hour burger joint. T-Bones, on Eglinton. Everything around there has changed, but T-Bones is somehow still there. This would be in 2007, at the age of 16.

The next major stage of development occurs around 2008--09, when I was around 18--19 years old. I moved to Stanstead, QC, in the Eastern Townships. Right on the border of Vermont. I worked for Sunset Pictures and Bashar Shbib, a major influence in my life that I can't talk about right now.

After that it's living on Greene with Jesse, Luke and Cal. That's where I lost my virginity at the age of 19. Laurin Liu, who holds the record for youngest member of parliament.

Then, onto welfare and living alone by Parc Lafontaine. The second major darkness. I was only there for about 8 months, even though it felt like forever.

## 2010--2014

![Marc's Flyer business card, designed by Olive Hine.](assets/images/marcsflyer.jpg)

After that, I returned to Toronto and started to pull myself together. Through happenstance, I found myself delivering flyers for a real estate agent. I really liked it and endeavoured to make a job out of it. I was successful for about a year or so, and lived in the only apartments I ever held in Toronto. They were both in Little Portugal, about a block from each other. Both rooms in boarding houses. The first was in the basement right off Dufferin and Alma. The place reeked of cat piss from the upstairs lady's million cats. A hoarder who had been living there alone had just died, or gone to jail; the apartment was overflowing with crap, but there was no-one. I lived there for a couple months until things got heated. Managed to find a room in a nicer rooming house just a few blocks away. I was able to take a shopping cart from the No Frills around the corner and move my things in one trip. My brother has a condo a stone's throw from there; my sister has lived on Lansdowne and Queen for over a decade.

I got a girlfriend from OkCupid. My first real girlfriend. Her name was Maggie. It was intense. I got restless after reading *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* and *On the Road* and became convinced that the "mountain-top" I needed to climb, after Zarathustra's injunction, involved a Kerouac style hobo sojourn. I worked extra hard for a bit, got my first ultralight kit together, and went to New Jersey. Maggie came with me and we had a little visit to New York City. I stayed at my father-in-law Daniel's place. Maggie and I broke up before I left heading to New Orleans. My first nights camping out, I was crying hopelessly. There were adventures out on the road. I visited Ecuador and Peru during this time, thanks to my friend Oliver.

Spent about six months in British Columbia. Four months living on the streets of Vancouver while working full-time as a pressure washer; and then in the kitchen at a summer camp near Squamish. There were some people I met, and days when things happened with such ease, that made me feel as though I had been transported into the 60s. It was all a function of living in the most yuppie of all the provinces. The same struggles carried with me, and after so long gone---in Toronto; then on the road---I decided that I needed to return home. I needed to return to the only friends I had ever had. I needed to return to Montréal.

That's when I moved into Hutchison. At that point it was Alex, Devin, Charise and myself. In December of 2014, I started working at Lawrence. Around the same time---before the New Year---I had met Noelle.

## 2015--2016

We started dating in the Winter of 2015. She changed my life, of course. In the Summer, she went to Campbellton, New Brunswick for a journalism internship. I visited her once, just for a few days; then I visited her again for an entire month. That was both a very exciting time, and a very miserable time. Lots of fighting. I started taking French lessons at the Centre Saint-Louis in the summer of 2015. That was around the same time that Jera and Hannah moved in. My relationship with Noelle continued in a very unpleasant on-again, off-again manner into the winter. It was snowy when I met Eden at La plante.

![The author circa 2015.](assets/images/me/mesmiling_jed.jpg)

At some point in the first half of 2016, I applied to Concordia in the Philosophy program. I took another month off to go to Halifax and micro-dose LSD on the beach. I got the news that I had been accepted into Concordia while I was out there. Eden and I were still together at this point---I have a postcard from her congratulating me---but it would be over by the time I start at Concordia in September.

## 2016---2019

Thus begins Concordia (phase one).

## 2020--2022

The Rachelle Years.

## 2023--*present*

End of the good years; perhaps the longest period of darkness yet. It feels sharper than it used to.

# The Artist's Studio

## My computer

Learning to use developer tools was an instrumental factor in developing my appreciation for hypermedia. Now I am able to edit the text of my website at the same time as its structure. This website is a work composed in different languages written alongside each other. The programming language is read by the audience as the visual design of the page; the other language is read in text and images. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.

My computer is a ThinkPad X1 Carbon (5th gen) that I've had since circa 2017. It's run Linux for most of its life. Arch, then Gentoo since Summer 2020.  I run a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/dwm) of the [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) window manager, alongside a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/st) of the [simple/suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org)

## The process of writing

Gass called it "a life in the chair," making a parallel to the electric chair. A life spent under the gallows.

## Astrological chart

![Natal chart.](assets/images/chart.gif)

Scorpio, rising Sagittarius. Full chart and reading forthcoming. Mars dominates my chart, but I have always preferred Pluto as a personal icon. I like astrology as a symbolic language, and a future project will be to analyze statistical correlations in certain readings. I like the materialism of astrological metaphysics...of course, I should admit as well that it has always been a useful tool for processing emotions. I have not studied astrophysics, I know barely anything about the history of astrology, and I am not even familiar with the signs, except for in a superficial way. Although my knowledge is superficial, my interest is genuine.

## Personality

Data forthcoming. I took the MBTI once when I was 18, and remember that I was an INTJ. We'll see how I compare these days.

## Morals and philosophy

Some keywords for you:

1. Cosmology: Epicurean atomism
2. Metaphysics: materialist
3. Ontology: force
3. Ethics: virtue ethics
4. Politics: Maoist

# Contact

!["I am a part of all living things!"](/assets/images/robo.jpg)

Here are links to my social media accounts, ranked in terms of activity. I can be reached through direct message on any of these platforms, and I encourage you to give me a follow. If you prefer, you can [email me](mailto:um.todoroff@gmail.com) or [leave anonymous feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckpSDCKX3uNollW7CJmZF5V3zumIljoDAWsf8ftB6HTNJIKw/viewform). I read everything and it brings me great joy to hear from people. I respond when I can---I think we are all familiar with the obstacle of maintaining our inboxes.

My current username is theinvertedform, a phrase that emerged to me out of my first reading of [*Capital*](/marx). Somewhere in the section on commodity fetishism, the words "inverted form" appear in close proximity. It wasn't until years later, when reading [*The Phenomenology of Spirit*](/hegel), that I came across the related phrase "the inverted world." I like "theinvertedform," especially as it's typeset. It's a bit emo; "the inverted world" perhaps even more so. Needless to say, I am claiming both of these as my titles, the latter for an as-yet unrealized project.

The URL for this website is simply my initials (Uriah Marc Todoroff). I chose the .world TLD as a reference to the concept from Hegel, and because I conceived of this website as being an entry-point into my world.
