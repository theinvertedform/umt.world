description: Links and information describing me.
abstract: "I am a communist writer, researcher, and critic of contemporary culture. My historical research is provoked by an analysis of emergent tendencies in contemporary culture, focusing on the visual, and always done in service of a better analysis of our shared present. Growing up alongside the digital, my interest in the Contemporary as a discrete social and cultural paradigm centres on questions including: the history and theory of new media forms; digital life and its technologically-mediated precedents; and the politics of aesthetics. My motivation to grasp the world began, as it does for all of us, upon learning that it is unjust. I have since developed my commitment to an alliance with the wretched of the earth and to the abolition of capital. I claim this as the fundamental a priori of all my striving for clarity of thought and for literary expression, hence why political questions are only occasionally explicit in my writing. My philosophical research tends to gravitate towards the German tradition on both sides of Marx (Kant/Hegel, Adorno/Benjamin/Lukacs); but the questions I have learned to ask of history and of politics are reflected in my ongoing encounter with the avant-garde, as well as the thick middle of mass media. My work represents an ongoing trace of the chaotic, yet motionless vortex of the Contemporary."

This page is all about me. It contains links to my social media around the internet; profiles and typological data (forthcoming); methodology; known biases; likes and dislikes; as well as information on the material elements of my practise and my research.

# Personal

## Work

I spent my 20s working in restaurants. It's a living, just another trade (even when you're working in fancy restaurants).

## Links

These are the social media that I am active on, ranked in terms of use. I can be reached through direct message on any of these platforms; if you prefer, you can also [email me](mailto:um.todoroff@gmail.com).

I have had many usernames over the years. My current one is theinvertedform, a phrase that emerged to me out of my first reading of [*Capital*](/marx). Somewhere in the section on commodity fetishism, the words "inverted form" appear in some close proximity. It wasn't until years later, when reading [*The Phenomenology of Spirit*](/hegel), that I came across the related phrase "the inverted world." Marx's phrase "the inverted form" is a reference to that concept taken from Hegel. I may use "The Inverted World" as a title for something, someday (podcast?).

I like "theinvertedform," especially as it's typeset. It's a bit emo, a bit 2000s-era punk; "the inverted world" even more so.

The URL for this website is simply my initials (Uriah Marc Todoroff). I don't quite recall if I chose the .world TLD as a reference to the concept from Hegel, but the timeline definitely matches up. For branding purposes, I have attempted to simplify and streamline: umt.world/umtworld is my cross-platform identifier; theinvertedform is my username.

## Material Cultures

### Technical setup

* Thinkpad X1 Carbon (5th gen). This is my main computer. I have a desktop that I use as a media server and as a backup. The laptop is starting to show its age. I yearn for a fully-modded Thinkpad X220.
* Gentoo Linux since roughly Summer 2020. Arch Linux for years before then. A brief spell of using Windows on a laptop, preceded by not having one. I first started experimenting with Linux around the age of 16, using Slackware and Ubuntu for a number of years.
* Vim. Against my best intentions, this editor has become a significant part of my identity and a crucial part of how I understand new media from a research--creation perspective.
* I have a generic 60% mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches. I like it and I like the tactility, but I hope to one day upgrade to either a vintage IBM Model M, or its continuation, the Mini-M.
* I run a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/dwm) of the [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) window manager, alongside a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/st) of the [simple/suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org)

### Note-taking

Studying is particular, and I am by no means claiming to be an expert. I like the system I have developed: it's quite simple, and makes sense to me. I try to remove as many arbitrary obstacles as possible. Basically, that means keeping lecture notes on loose-leaf, three-ring punch paper---the most common type of paper, in my experience. Notes use a simple indentation system, where I write the main point or concept, and track an argument through levels of indentation.

Recently, in my final semester, I learned about the concept of Zettelkasten, or the systematic use of index cards as a technique for organizing notes. I learned about it from my research into Walter Benjamin's practises. More information on this is forthcoming when I gain more experience on the matter.

## Education

* Laura Secord Elementary (Toronto, circa 1993--1998, 1999)
* General Crerar Primary (Toronto, circa 2001)
* MIND High School (Montréal, circa 2004--2005; 2007)
* Options II (Montréal, circa 2006--2007)
* David & Mary Thompson Collegiate Institute (Toronto, circa 2007--2008)
* Concordia University (Montréal, 2016--2019; 2021-2023)

## Profile

I default to introverted, but am secretly gregarious. I am emotionally unstable, highly sensitive---but implacable.

### Appearance

How can you know me, without knowing what I look like? Here is a description of my style, how I comport myself; I will also collect photographs to construct a chronological visual narrative.

### Astrological chart

![Natal chart.](assets/images/chart.gif)

Scorpio, rising Sagittarius. Full chart and reading forthcoming. Mars dominates my chart, but I have always preferred Pluto as a personal icon. I like astrology as a symbolic language, and a future project will be to analyze statistical correlations in certain readings. I like the materialism of astrological metaphysics...of course, I should admit as well that it has always been a useful tool for processing emotions. I have not studied astrophysics, I know barely anything about the history of astrology, and I am not even familiar with the signs, except for in a superficial way. Although my knowledge is superficial, my interest is genuine.

### Personality

Data forthcoming. I took the MBTI once when I was 18, and remember that I was an INTJ. We'll see how I compare these days.

### Morals

Some keywords for you:

1. Cosmology: Epicurean atomism
2. Metaphysics: materialist
3. Ontology: force
3. Ethics: virtue ethics
4. Politics: Maoist
