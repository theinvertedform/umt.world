title: About the Author
description: Links and information describing me.
abstract: I am a writer, philosopher, historical researcher, and fiction writer. I am interested in questions of modernity, society, and the contemporary visual regime of digital life; philosophically, I am interested in Marxism and the philosophy of art. The basis of my critical practise is an ongoing encounter with contemporary culture, the exploratory edge of my philosophical worldview. My literary process offers my own aesthetic representation of the present. My practise as an artist is influenced by generic conventions, and the potential of narrative to provoke emotional reflection in the reader. My writing attempts to express what is at stake in the structuring concerns common to the present. Narrative techniques are the organizing principle of my practise, all of which constitutes a totality that moves dialectically between rhetorical and narrative modes.

This page is all about me. It contains links to my social media around the internet; profiles and typological data (forthcoming); methodology; known biases; likes and dislikes; as well as information on the material elements of my practise and my research.

# Links

These are the social media that I am active on, ranked in terms of use. I can be reached through direct message on any of these platforms; if you prefer, you can also [email me](mailto:um.todoroff@gmail.com).

I have had many usernames over the years. My current one is theinvertedform, a phrase that emerged to me out of my first reading of [*Capital*](/marx). Somewhere in the section on commodity fetishism, the words "inverted form" appear in some close proximity. It wasn't until years later, when reading [*The Phenomenology of Spirit*](/hegel), that I came across the related phrase "the inverted world." Marx's phrase "the inverted form" is a reference to that concept taken from Hegel. I may use "The Inverted World" as a title for something, someday (podcast?).

I like "theinvertedform," especially as it's typeset. It's a bit emo, a bit 2000s-era punk; "the inverted world" even more so.

The URL for this website is simply my initials (Uriah Marc Todoroff). I don't quite recall if I chose the .world TLD as a reference to the concept from Hegel, but the timeline definitely matches up. For branding purposes, I have attempted to simplify and streamline: umt.world/umtworld is my cross-platform identifier; theinvertedform is my username.

# Formation

## Astrological chart

Scorpio, rising Sagittarius. Full chart forthcoming. Although Mars dominates my chart, I have always preferred Pluto as a personal icon. I like astrology as a symbolic language; I like the materialism of astrological metaphysics, and it has always been a useful tool for processing emotions. I have not studied astrophysics, I know barely anything about the history of astrology, and I am not even familiar with the signs, except for in a superficial way (it's on my [to-do list](/about#to-do). My interest in astrology has an element of irony, and my knowledge is superficial, but it is a sincere interest.

# Things I Use

## Technical setup

* Thinkpad X1 Carbon (5th gen). This is my main computer. I have a desktop that I use as a media server and as a backup. The laptop is starting to show its age. I yearn for a fully-modded Thinkpad X220.
* Gentoo Linux since roughly Summer 2020. Arch Linux for years before then. A brief spell of using Windows on a laptop, preceded by not having one. I first started experimenting with Linux around the age of 16, using Slackware and Ubuntu for a number of years.
* Vim. Against my best intentions, this editor has become a significant part of my identity and a crucial part of how I understand new media from a research--creation perspective.
* I have a generic 60% mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches. I like it and I like the tactility, but I hope to one day upgrade to either a vintage IBM Model M, or its continuation, the Mini-M.
* I run a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/dwm) of the [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) window manager, alongside a [fork](https://github.com/theinvertedform/st) of the [simple/suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org)
