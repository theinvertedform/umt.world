/* NOTIFICATIONS */

/*  The GW.notificationCenter object allows us to register handler functions for
    named events. Any number of handlers may be registered for any given named
    event, and when that event is fired, all of its registered handlers will be
    called. Because event handlers are registered for events by event name
    (which may be any string we like), a handler may be registered for an event
    at any time and at any location in the code. (In other words, an event does
    not need to first be “defined”, nor needs to “exist” in any way, in order
    for a handler to be registered for it.)

    We can also make the calling of any given event handler conditional (with a
    user-defined, handler-specific condition function [closure] that dynamically
    determines whether its associated handler should be called or not, when the
    event the handler was registered for is fired), specify that an event
    handler should be called only once or many times, and group handlers for a
    particular event into named “phases” (to ensure that certain handlers for an
    event are always called before/after others).

    Events themselves are also user-defined. Causing an event to fire is as
    simple as calling GW.notificationCenter.fireEvent() and providing an event
    name (which may be any string), plus an event info dictionary (which may
    contain any keys and values we deem necessary, and which will be passed to
    the handler functions); this will trigger the calling of all the handlers
    that have been registered for that event name.

    See the comments on specific elements of GW.notificationCenter, below, for
    more information.
 */
GW.notificationCenter = {
    /*  Dictionary of registered event handlers for named events.

        KEYS are event names (e.g. ‘GW.contentDidLoad’).

        VALUES are arrays of handler definitions for each event. Each handler
        definition is a dictionary with the following keys/values:

        - ‘f’ (key)
            Handler function to call when the named event fires (passing the
            event info dictionary of the fired event). (See comment on the
            ‘addHandlerForEvent’ function, below, for details.)

        - ‘options’ (key) [optional]
            Event options dictionary, with the following keys/values:

            - ‘condition’ (key) [optional]
                Test function, to which the event info dictionary of the fired
                event is passed; the handler function is called if (and only if)
                the condition returns true.

            - ‘once’ (key) [optional]
                Boolean value; if true, the handler will be removed after the
                handler function is called once (note that if there is a
                condition function provided [see the ‘condition’ key], the
                handler function will not be called - and therefore will not be
                removed - if the named event is fired but the condition
                evaluates to false).

                If not set, defaults to false (ie. by default a handler is
                not removed after an event is fired once, but will continue to
                be invoked each time the named event fires and the condition,
                if any, evaluates as true).

            - ‘phase’ (key) [optional]
                String which specifies when the given handler function should be
                called, relative to other handlers registered for the named
                event.

                The format for this string is as follows:

                - If the entire string is equal to “<”, then the given handler
                  function will be called prior to any handlers that are
                  assigned to any other phase (or to no specific phase). (Within
                  this “before all others” ‘pseudo-phase’, handlers are called
                  in the order in which they were added.)

                - If the entire string is equal to “>”, then the given handler
                  function will be called after any handlers that are assigned
                  to any other phase (or to no specific phase). (Within this
                  “after all others” ‘pseudo-phase’, handlers are called in the
                  order in which they were added.)

                - If the string is empty, then the given handler function will
                  be called after all other handlers, but before any handlers
                  that were assigned to phase “>”. (Within this “no particular
                  phase” ‘pseudo-phase’, handlers are called in the order in
                  which they were added.)

                - If the first character is anything other than ‘<’ or ‘>’, the
                  entire string is treated as the name of a handler phase. The
                  given handler function will be called in the same handler
                  phase as all other handlers assigned to that phase. (Within a
                  phase, handlers are called in the order in which they were
                  added.)

                - If the first character is ‘<’, then the rest of the string
                  is treated as the name of a handler phase. The given handler
                  function will be called prior to any handlers assigned to the
                  specified phase, but after any handlers assigned to an earlier
                  named phase (if any). (Within such a “before phase X”
                  ‘pseudo-phase’, handlers are called in the order in which they
                  were added.)

                - If the first character is ‘>’, then the rest of the string
                  is treated as the name of a handler phase. The given handler
                  function will be called after any handlers assigned to the
                  specified phase, but before any handlers assigned to a later
                  named phase (if any). (Within such an “after phase X”
                  ‘pseudo-phase’, handlers are called in the order in which they
                  were added.)

        When an event is fired, any handlers registered for that event (ie.
        members of the array which is the value for that event’s name in the
        eventHandlers dictionary) are called in array order. (If a condition is
        specified for any given handler, the handler function is only called if
        the condition function - called with the event info dictionary as its
        argument - evaluates true.)

        The order of an event handlers array for a given event is, by default,
        determined by the order in which handlers are registered for that event.
        The value of the ‘phase’ key of an event’s options dictionary can
        override and modify this default order. (See definition of the ‘phase’
        key of an event handler options dictionary, above.)

        (See definition of the ‘phase’ key of an event handler options
         dictionary, above, for more info.)

        Phases are defined in execution order. For example, consider a
        hypothetical GW.exampleDidHappen event, whose handler phases are defined
        as follows: `[ "foo", "bar" ]`. When the GW.exampleDidHappen event
        fires, event handlers are called in the following order:

        1. Handlers assigned to be called before all other phases (ie. those
           with ‘<’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key in their event handler
           options dictionary)
        2. Handlers assigned to be called before the ‘foo’ phase (ie.
           those with ‘<foo’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key in their
           event handler options dictionary)
        3. Handlers assigned to be called during the ‘foo’ phase (ie.
           those with ‘foo’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key in their
           event handler options dictionary)
        4. Handlers assigned to be called after the ‘foo’ phase (ie.
           those with ‘>foo’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key in their
           event handler options dictionary)
        5. Handlers assigned to be called before the ‘bar’ phase
           (ie. those with ‘<bar’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key
           in their event handler options dictionary)
        6. Handlers assigned to be called during the ‘bar’ phase
           (ie. those with ‘bar’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key
           in their event handler options dictionary)
        7. Handlers assigned to be called after the ‘bar’ phase
           (ie. those with ‘>bar’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key
           in their event handler options dictionary)
        8. Handlers assigned to be called after all other phases (ie. those
           with ‘>’ as the value of their ‘phase’ key in their event handler
           options dictionary)

        (Handlers with no specified phase might be called at any point after
         step 1 and before step 8 in this sequence, depending on when they were
         registered.)

/* LOAD & INJECT HANDLERS */

/*******************************************************************************/
/*  NOTE on the GW.contentDidLoad and GW.contentDidInject events:

    These events are fired whenever any new local page content is loaded and
    injected into the page, respectively. (Here “loaded” may mean “loaded via a
    network request”, “constructed from a template”, or any other process by
    which a new unit of page content is created. This includes the initial page
    load, but also such things as annotations being lazy-loaded, etc. Likewise,
    “injected” may mean “injected into the base page”, “injected into a
    pop-frame shadow-root”, “injected into a DocumentFragment in cache”, etc.)

    Many event handlers are attached to these, because a great deal of
    processing must take place before newly-loaded page content is ready for
    presentation to the user. Typography rectification must take place; the HTML
    structure of certain page elements (such as tables, figures, etc.) must be
    reconfigured; CSS classes must be added; various event listeners attached;
    etc. Most of rewrite.js consists of exactly such “content load handlers” and
    “content inject handlers”, a.k.a. “rewrite functions”. (Additional content
    load and inject handlers are defined elsewhere in the code, as appropriate;
    e.g. the handler that attaches event listeners to annotated links to load
    annotations when the user mouses over such links, which is found in
    extracts-annotations.js.)

    The GW.contentDidLoad event has the following named handler phases (see
    above for details on what this means):

        [ "transclude", "rewrite" ]

    The GW.contentDidInject event has the following named handler phases:

        [ "rewrite", "eventListeners" ]

    The GW.contentDidLoad and GW.contentDidInject events should have the
    following keys and values in their event info dictionary (see above
    for details on event info dictionaries):

        ‘source’ (key) (required)
            String that indicates function (or event name, if fired from a
            browser event listener) from which the event is fired (such as
            ‘Annotation.load’).

        ‘container’ (key) (required)
            DOM object containing the loaded content. (For the GW.contentDidLoad
            event fired on the initial page load, the value of this key is
            `document`, i.e. the root document of the page. For pop-frames, this
            may be the `document` property of the pop-frame, or a
            DocumentFragment containing the embedded page elements.) The
            container will contain nothing but the newly-loaded content.
            (This key can be thought of as “what has been loaded?”.)

        ‘document’ (key) (required)
            Document into which the content was loaded. May or may not be
            identical with the value of the ‘container’ key (in those cases when
            the loaded content is a whole document itself). The value of this
            key is necessarily either a Document (i.e., the root document of the
            page) or a DocumentFragment. (This key can be thought of as “into
            where has the loaded content been loaded?”.)

        ‘contentType’ (key)
            String that indicates content type of the loaded content. Might be
            null (which indicates the default content type: local page content).
            Otherwise may be `annotation` or something else.

        ‘loadLocation’ (key)
            URL object (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)
            which specifies the URL from which the loaded content was loaded.
            For the main page, the represented URL will be the value of
            `location.href`. For pop-frames, transcludes, etc., the represented
            URL will be that of the page in which the content resides. (If the
            loaded/injected content is not sourced from any page, this key will
            have a null value.)

    The GW.contentDidInject event should additionally have a value for the
    following key:

        ‘flags’ (key) (required)
            Bit field containing various flags (combined via bitwise OR). The
            values of the flags are defined in GW.contentDidInjectEventFlags.

            (Note that event handlers for the ‘GW.contentDidInject’ event can
             access the values of these flags directly via property access on
             the event info, e.g. the following two expressions are equivalent:

               eventInfo.flags & GW.contentDidInjectEventFlags.clickable != 0

               eventInfo.clickable

             It is recommended that the latter form be used.)

            The flags are:

            ‘clickable’
                Currently unused. Reserved for future use.

            ‘stripCollapses’
                Specifies whether the loaded content is permitted to have
                collapsed sections. Generally false. If the value of this key
                is true, then any collapse blocks in the loaded content will be
                automatically expanded and stripped, and all content in
                collapsible sections will be visible at all times.

            ‘fullWidthPossible’
                Specifies whether full-width elements are permitted in the
                loaded content. Generally true only for the main page load. If
                false, elements marked as full-width will be laid out as if for
                a mobile (narrow) viewport, regardless of the actual dimensions
                of the loaded content’s container (i.e. they will not actually
                be “full-width”).

            ‘localize’
                Specifies whether content should be “localized” to the context
                into which it is being injected. (Affects things like link
                qualification. See transclude.js for more information.)
                Generally true for page content, false for auxiliary content.

            ‘mergeFootnotes’
                Specifies whether footnotes in the content will be merged into
                the page wherein the content is being injected. Inapplicable on
                the initial page load, generally false for auxiliary content;
                generally true for page content, if the ‘localize’ flag is true
                (although false in some cases even then; see, e.g., the
                .include-content-core alias class in transclude.js).

/********************/
/* EVENT LISTENERS */

GW.eventListeners = { };

/******************************************************************************/
/*  Adds a named event listener to the page (or other target).

    The purpose of this function is to dramatically improve the performance of
    handler code attached to continuous UI events, such as scrolling (i.e., the 
    “scroll” event, attached to any scroll container) or window resizing (i.e., 
    the “resize” event, attached to the `window` object).

    Because such events are fired at a rate independent of the actual current
    animation frame rate, using the usual event listener system to attach 
    handlers to events of this sort causes performance to suffer, as the 
    handler is called much more often than necessary, leading to lag.

    The solution is to add an event listener that fires only once (the next 
    time the event is triggered); waits for the next animation frame; runs the 
    requisite code; then adds itself as an event listener again. This has the
    effect of running the handler code at most once per animation frame, no 
    matter how much more often the event is fired.

    This behavior is abstracted into an API which easily replaces the built-in 
    addEventListener() API.

    Available option fields:

    name (string)
        A string identifier for the event listener being added. If a name is
        provided, then a reference to the event listener is retained, such that
        the listener may later be removed (see the removeNamedEventListener()
        function).

        Provided names must be unique per event. (A listener “foo” for event 
        “bar” attached to object `baz` will overwrite a listener “foo” for 
        event “bar” attached to object `quux`.)

    defer (boolean)
        If set to true, and the page has not yet finished loading, then the 
        provided handler is not added immediately, but only on the next 
        animation frame after the page has finished loading (using the 
        doWhenPageLoaded() function). (If the page *has* finished loading, then
        the handler is added on the immediately next animation frame.)

        (This is useful for code that implements a UI behavior which should not 
         operate prior to the page having loaded and appropriate on-load setup 
         code having run.)

    ifDeferCallWhenAdd (boolean)
        If the `defer` option is enabled (set to true), this option controls 
        whether the provided handler function is called immediately, just prior
        to the event listener being added.

        Essentially, setting this to `true` means that we are assuming that the 
        event in question will have fired at least once between the beginning 
        of the page load process and the deferred moment when we actually add 
        the listener, and thus the handler code should be run.

        NOTE: The invocation of the handler function (fn()) immediately prior 
        to the event listener being added will *not* have any event object 
        passed to it (because it’s not being triggered by a fired event, nor
        called within a listener function that was triggered by a fired event).
        The handler function must be able to handle the case of an undefined
        `event` argument, if this option is used!

        (This option has no effect if the `defer` option is not enabled.)
