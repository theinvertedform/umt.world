title: Website to-do
---

# Git-related
- ~~Add a link to page commit history in metadata~~
- ~~"Last revised" parenthetical on diary entries with link to commit history~~

# Changelog
- Group items together under a single list item per category of writing
- Add an overall summary of changes to ongoing projects (like the diary)
- Add a summary of changes per month: how many commits, changes in word count and LOC, new references

# Posts
- Side-notes and margin-notes
- Backlinks section for posts, including diary entries
- Section headers on posts should be a link to their anchor
- Lightbox option for images
- Slideshow option for images
- Images that stretch to fill the screen
- Style image borders, add shadows

# Pandoc-related
- Automatic section for bibliography

# Index
- Graphic to separate section clusters
- Different list style type for different sections

# Site-wide
- ~~Change sidebar to top-style navbar~~
- We need algorithmically-generated typography depending on the different viewport sizes
- Custom icons for lists
- We need a better emblem
- Superscript icon to designate external links

# Diaries
- Re-structure the diary into chronological chapters
	- How does the voice of the diaries relate to the voice used throughout the website?
- Metadata about how many times a post has changed, and to what extent, with a link that preserves the full history of each unit of text
- Automatically-generated tags 
- Character index that is still anonymous (?)
- The pages should generally be more rich, dynamic, with more multi-media

# About
- Until we have a proper essay ready, this page would probably be better off as an annotated bibliography and a collection of visual inspiration
