title: Website to-do
---

# Git-related
- Incorporate git log into the website changelog
- Links to the page's commit history in page / post metadata
- "Last revised" parenthetical on diary entries with link to commit history

# Changelog
- Style the changelog page so that it's actually informative and useful
	- Group items together under a category

# Posts
- Side-notes and margin-notes
- Backlinks section for posts, including diary entries
- Section headers on posts should be a link to their anchor
- Lightbox for selected images
- Image slideshows
- Images that stretch to fill all usable margin space
- Style image borders

# Pandoc-related
- All citations on a page should be included in a single bibliography, at the end of the page
- Automatic section for bibliography

# Index
- Graphic to separate section clusters on index

# Site-wide
- Change sidebar to top-style navbar
- Improve the typography, especially line height and word-spacing
- Custom icons for lists with automatic alternation
- We need a better emblem
- Superscript icon to designate external links

# Diaries
- Re-structure the diary into chapters
	- What order are they listed?
	- How does the voice of the diaries relate to the voice used throughout the website?
- Metadata about how many times a post has changed, and to what extent
- Automatically-generated tags 
- Character index that is still anonymous
- The pages should generally be more rich, dynamic, with more visual and audio material

# About
- Until we have a proper essay ready, this page would probably be better off as an annotated bibliography and a collection of visual inspiration
