description: "Selections from my diary and other sundry one-offs."
abstract: My blogging habits go back to a few initial posts on MySpace circa 2004--2005. These then evolved into [alt.conform](https://altdotconform.blogspot.com), a teenage project hosted on Blogspot. In addition to these writings is a constant practise of writing in notebooks and journals, some of which I occasionally transcribe and post here. My [film diary](https://letterboxd.com/user/theinvertedform/films/diary) has a certain diaristic element to it. Diary writing is an interesting form that I continue to explore.

> I toss these pages in the faces of timid, furtive, respectable people and say: ‘There! that’s me! You may like it or lump it, but it’s true. And I challenge you to follow suit, to flash the searchlight of your self-consciousness into every remotest corner of your life and invite everybody’s inspection. Be candid, be honest, break down the partitions of your cubicle, come out of your burrow, little worm.’ As we are all such worms we should at least be honest worms.
