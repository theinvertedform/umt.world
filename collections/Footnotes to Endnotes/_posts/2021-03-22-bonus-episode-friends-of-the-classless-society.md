In this episode, we are reading and discussing two essays from the Berlin communiser group Friends of the Classless Society. We spend a fair amount of time recounting a history of 20th century revolution that we are all familiar with at this point; we also discuss Adorno and his idea of a “classless class society,” as well as some of his ideas on culture.
