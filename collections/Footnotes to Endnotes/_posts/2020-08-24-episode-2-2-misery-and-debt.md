In this week’s episode of the podcast, join Uriah and Owen as they discuss and analyze the left-communist text “Misery and Debt,” published in 2010 by the Endnotes Collective. This is one of the most important essays in contemporary Marxian economics that has emerged after the 2008 crisis, and provides an invaluable corrective to 20th century bourgeois arguments against the tendency of the rate of profit to fall.

Learn more about important concepts like simple reproduction and expanded reproduction, surplus population, the industrial reserve army, and what it means that profit inevitably declines within the capitalist system over time.
