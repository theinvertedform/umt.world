Professor and editor of Communization and its Discontents Benjamin Noys joins Uriah for a discussion on today’s episode of the pod. We’ve read a few essays on the pod, and for this discussion we take Endnotes’s critical appraisal of Tiqqun / The Invisible Committee as our starting point. We cover the political and cultural context in the UK at the time of the group’s splinter from the journal Aufheben; we cover the intellectual milieu in France and Italy at the same time, before getting into the precise differences between the anarchist and the Marxist tendencies of communization theory. In the end, we assess the contemporary legacy of these two different publications, and their impact on anti-capitalist struggle.

We have a lot more interviews lined up in the New Year, and we will finally have a way for fans of the show to support us on Patreon. Subscribe to the YouTube channel, where I release videos (nearly) daily: https://www.youtube.com/c/theinvertedform
