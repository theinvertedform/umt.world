title: Generations and Worlds
---

There's a story-review to be written about *Les jours parfaits*. Going to see it with A--, her response ("cringe, interminable..."); meanwhile, I'm over here relating intensely. Communication across generations, the disjuncture of individual worlds are themes in the film. Is there something new in the world, or has my perception of the phenomenon (aging) changed?

What voice could be appropriate for this kind of story? There might be something in the events that constitute enough for a narrative, but the problem is coming up with a perspective that is in itself worth exploring. That extra touch is what distinguishes literature from narration. That's what I don't have.
