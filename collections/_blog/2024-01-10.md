title: What I Should Actually Do
---

Back at Pastel Rita, caught up with my friend. Crush is not here. Good/bad? Who knows.

Now it's time for the next project. It's time for the Spinoza story. This one also has a weird timeline. We need to come up with better techniques for moving through time---we can practise, at least.

What will I read? Well, today, what I should actually do is try to put together some resources on writing workshops. That's one objective; the second is to think about where/how I can improve *The Truth is Haunted*.
