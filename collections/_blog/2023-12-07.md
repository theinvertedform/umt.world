title: Bring the Piece to the End
---

Writing + working. Very strange combo. The job is very demanding in terms of memory. I need to remember all the recipes, and the menu. And also how to do the job. All the language. What else? Cleaning everything is fine, that's easy. Everything else is hard. What?

Writing at the same time. Tomorrow I can work on it, on the story.

Invocation to the person I love, want to love. That's the goal. To bring the piece to the end. It needs to have some more action.

11h---At Olimpico. The plan today is to work on the story, and that's all. Aside from that---we have gym in a few hours, and then work.
