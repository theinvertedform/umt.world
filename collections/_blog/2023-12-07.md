title: Bring the Piece to the End
---

Writing + working. Very strange combo. The job is very demanding in terms of memory. I need to remember all the recipes for the cocktails, as well as the menu. The floor plan is simple, but also needs to be memorized. And I need to remember how to do the job, but that's memory is in my muscles, thankfully, which are bigger than my synapses. All the language, the vocabulary. What else? Cleaning is easy; everything else is hard.

I'm writing at the same time. Tomorrow I can work on the story. Right now I work on *this* word and *this* word.

Invocation to the person I love, want to love. That's the goal. To bring the piece to the end. It needs more action.

*11h*---At O. The plan today is to work on the story and nothing else. Aside from that---we have gym in a few hours, and then---work! A structure is emerging.
