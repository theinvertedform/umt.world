Sick---did fuck all this week. Today I got an email that I was accepted into the University of Western Ontario. The financing seems very generous. The guy said they were impressed---by *The Truth is Haunted*, and that dogshit throw-up from FMST 222?! Wow, LOL!

How am I going to feel if they let me into Concordia? It might kill me. WTF!! Right now, I am avoiding going home, because it's full of people. Strangers. Scared. I met a girl, sort of---she was so nice! Sometimes I feel like an absolute piece of shit. I'm terrible at my job. I am going to work in a restaurant forever---I should be so lucky! 2 jobs, full time...if I ever am married, then my motivation to work in restauration will be gone.

The grass is always greener---elsewhere. If I go to UWO, then I will have FOMO from not being here. If I go to Concordia, then I will always wonder---what might have been.

That girl---has a shop; and she has an old, blind greyhound. She's a local celebrity. She's funny, she's cool, she's really nice to service staff. She likes her funky natural wines. She addresses me in English. Wow. Radiant energy. Red carpet vibes. Powerful---so what's she doing with me? Nothing: it was all a dream...
