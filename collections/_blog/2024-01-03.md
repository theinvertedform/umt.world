title: Which Tool is Appropriate?
---

Head still swimming. Entire inner world destabilized. Went to the gym yesterday, somehow. Amazing, really. Felt quite weak on the OHP, and generally un-co-ordinated, but I managed to do eight exercises. Four sets of dips, very long rests. One steam / cold plunge.

The house is falling apart. Can't think about that. I need to do a proofread on all my documents, then submit them. Get it out of the way. Both. Then get some tool to unscrew the faucet and try to fix it. Then legs day, WTF. That's going to be hard.
