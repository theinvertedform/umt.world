The problem with the Jekyll post format is that it's a lot of work to create a new file. It's a barrier to entry. I would prefer to just be able to add to the top of a file. One long file, with multiple metadata blocks, so that we can continue to associate tags with posts.

What I'm doing now is collating separate posts into one long page. It looks the same for the reader, but it's not as good an experience for the user of the system.
