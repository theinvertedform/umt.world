title: First Day of Snow
---

First day of snow. Suddenly the winter we were waiting for has Become. No longer just an extended spring, but **winter**---season of snow.

Today the goal is to send draft letters to all my referees; to work on the portfolio; to work at the gym at 80% of my last PR week; to shave.
