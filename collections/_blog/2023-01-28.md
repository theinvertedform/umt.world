Leave it all behind and start again. Save for a few years, practise on the side; when it comes time, retreat again even further. That's what it takes to write a book. I should be on my third or fourth book by the time I'm in my mid-thirties. Each one closer to publishing. Keep it up during work-time because I have nothing else. Encountering no-one but---myself. It sounds like a nightmarish torture; she said she was doing me a favour, and that I would be glad to be alone after she left me.

Can't say that I have been glad. Careless, maybe, in the sense that I have nothing to care about. The part of me that is presently dead, that I need in order to move on, was already dead. But it's always been dead. I'm back to ground zero. When I went through previous breakups, I had a society. Now I have nothing. Lost it all in the course of our time together. I look forward to forgetting what brought me to suffering, nothing left but me with my miserable self. 

There's no more future for me as a happy man: the only thing I can hope to do is make money and keep writing. My only optimism is the lure of a new idea. I am coming to a point where my skill is beginning to cohere.
