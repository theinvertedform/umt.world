Idea for a portfolio piece: a short work, almost like a chant, all rhythm, and it is almost entirely questions. Give it some form, but its function is to list everything I know, everything I've ever wanted to learn, everything I've ever asked myself. Give it a kind of chronology, make it also a story of coming-of-age. The questions compound. Start with writing Jack and the Bean-stalk [in kindergarten, first memory of forming words]; then copying out Narnia; then writing stories and poems to express my sexual and power fantasies. The poem I wrote about 9/11. Then the unleashing of imagination, in the form of both writing and reading. Musical father, visual mother. Both proletariat. Make the reader feel the sensation of being on the outside. There can also be dialogue, the ultimate signifier of narrative writing.
