title: Mellowed Out Tan
---

Always feels harder than normal to be somewhere without wanting to talk. But I love a cup of coffee: hot, bitter, mellowed out to a nice tan with some milk.

Can I get away with using Glissant as the source of my Indigenous cosmology?

- Mound Builders
- Architecture gives us access to cosmology? 
- Architecture is more metaphysical than other media?
