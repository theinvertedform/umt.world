Sometimes I am so drawn into the pleasure of my sensing-body that I lapse into idyll, and therefore need to be reminded of my facticity. The scorching ray of an all-seeing eye falls on me, and I am brought crashing back down into my paper-body. Who I have been---and by some vague extension, not lacking in a Protestant ethic, who I am privileged to be now.

We might feel differently about the organism our *cogito* is attached to, but no-one likes to be interpellated. In the course of a life, each of us will sew an idol representing ourselves; and if we fail to repay our debts, it is the duty of our creditor to stick pins through the stuffing of our joints and send bolts of pain screaming out of the blue light of an interface, glimpsed in the half-light of a bored moment at the bar. Sometimes I lapse into idyll, and therefore need to be reminded of my own facticity. A facade of sociality that slips beneath the waves of forgetting, laying bare an iron edifice of fiduciary obligation. There's no more rude awakening than a reminder of our economic trail. I tried to set fire to my icon as though it were a Wicker Man, but the rain put it out. My debts haunt me like a spectre that phases into the corporeal when I need to be disciplined, before disappearing back into the alien unknown. A creature of the imagination hovering on the edge of my peripheral, tinting my vision black when the pain overcomes me out of nowhere. *Don't make me do it. I don't like it any more than you do.* The trace of the way we lived in the world; who we are, best understood as *who we are no longer*. A tether to the past, an unjust fetter, but---let's be honest: have we really changed? Aren't we still the same desperate phylum scrabbling for survival, borrowing money without a plan for how to pay it back, from someone whose memory will always trigger a split dioptre? 

Remember? Remember? She's still there, out of sight but adjacent, still in the same world as you.

*hello*
