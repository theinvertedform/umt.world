title: A Home for Wayward Boys
---

A home for wayward boys, but the plot of land it's on emits a permanent stink....

My sister goes to the bar and knows everyone. I go to the bar and am alone---surrounded, yes, by a vague *connaissance* of many people, but I remain alone.

A girl with whom I once made conversation looks away awkwardly. I must look really bad. I must smell bad. My pheromones are rank. My aura gives off invisible stink lines.

title: Chasing Numbers
---

Apply at Concordia. Send pitches for the Wolfgang review. Read Gravity's Rainbow. Read Hegel. Go to the gym. Figure something out with the money. Apply for a few more jobs. 

At what point during all of this am I going to find a wife? Where's the progress there? Instead, I sublimate my desire into the gym, into this diary. If I can't be happy, at least I can be a jacked artist. Bring the weight on. I want to press a plate overhead!

title: E--'s First Class of the Semester
---

In the VA lunchroom before E--'s first class of the semester. The question weighing on me right now is, how am I going to keep writing after the inspiration of the APCON piece? I must not lose momentum. I need to be sending out pitches---multiple every day; for the Wolfgang review, for whatever. Publish it anywhere, so long as it's somewhere (other than here).

We need to finish *Morning Regrets*. It needs to be an actual story. That means an ending, which means *change*. A guy who imagines that religiosity would fill the void.

*Later*---This class is a sausage fest. More than usual for E--'s classes. Being in a strange room, next to the queen mother (E--): it feels very overwhelming. I wonder if I belong here---based on how many other guys there are, the answer seems to be yes.

title: On the *via negativa*
---

My goal right now is to respond to V--'s email, and to send the pitch to at least one more magazine.

Can't do the latter. Difficult enough to do the former. Too distracted by thoughts of girls. The desire for love. I am not available to women. They don't know about me. I am not there. No-one cares. And they're right not to, because I'm fucking ugly. I have no friends. Loser---no-one wants you, no-one ever will.

The goal for this weekend is to pitch the Wolfgang review to at least 3 places. Emails to be sent out on Monday. Start pitching it indiscriminately: a 1k word column. That's all I want to show for it. Something short, funny, sassy, that people will read. Will want to read. Just 1000 words.

*Just before 16h*---Everything is futile. I have zero prospects. Nothing but sadness, loneliness. Life of the modern gymcel. Life of the modern man. I should go back to l'Escogriffe and tell that girl the truth: that I liked the look in her eyes. I liked the way they flashed in that half-second, as she was dodging drunks. I couldn't stop thinking about it.

*'Round midnight*---Maybe if I wore more tonal outfits, like the cowboy white-hat on the couch opposite me---here, now, at CDP. Maybe if I had bigger side delts someone would love me. Maybe if I had used sunscreen in the morning for the past ten years, and my face were not so wrinkled; maybe If I were one degree higher in my profession. Maybe if I had finished that third reading of the *Phenomenology of Spirit*, someone would love me.

My relationship to women is almost entirely parasocial. Few friends, few real interactions; instead, just---the hot girls I ogle at work. The hot girls I ogle while at their work. Is this life better or worse than using an app? A seemingly-infinite series of possibilities emerge from out of the city. Bars, fake third spaces, are *here*---I'm at one right now, in fact. Apps are not here: they are an added layer of mediation. We best approximate God through reduction (*via negativa*). Our communist utopia similarly requires one single change (global abolishment of class) to the vast network of social relations. Most importantly, happiness (wife) will be found by removing everything else in life until only she remains.

Saw E-- last week; saw J-- and her Lil' Peep boyfriend today. Next time, it will be C-- ---or more likely, R--. Maybe A-- is back in town. I saw M--'s face floating in the crowd of a street festival. I haven't seen her in years, but the memory of her returned to me instantly. The mysteries of the city conspires with memory to confirm the purposiveness of life.

Even after all this time, I see this person and I feel like I could love her. Is it just because I formed an attachment when I still had my naivety? She has a connection to the earth, I have a watery depth. We are both graves to each other.

*Later, in front of La Rama, around 2am*---What exactly is the idea with all this stupid writing? There's nothing else to do...The taste of tequila is still on my lips, stronger than this nice beer I have.

One thing: I learned the girl from l'E's name. L--. That never would have happened if D-- hadn't been there. If not for her---well, we know I would not have been able to ask. But I did have the opportunity to learn, and learn I did---that she has a boyfriend.

Describe her: L--, bartender and "technical director" at l'E. Loose cuff on synthetic black pants; cheap, beat up running shoes. Smiling and friendly in a plain and homely kind of way, but evidently habituated to the big city life. The most feminine element of her appearance is her hair. Long, wavy, down past the shoulders, the tips holding on to the remainder of a blonde dye job.

Sometimes I am so drawn into the pleasure of my sensing-body that I lapse into idyll, and it's then that Life needs to remind me of my own facticity. The scorching ray of an all-seeing eye falls on me, and I am brought crashing back down into a paper body. Who I have been anchors me, a Protestant fetter that privileges me to be who I am now.

We might feel differently about the organism our *cogito* is attached to, but no-one likes to be interpellated. In the course of a life, each of us will sew an idol representing ourselves; and if we fail to repay our debts, it is the duty of our creditor to stick pins through the stuffing of our joints and send bolts of pain screaming out of the blue light of an interface, glimpsed in the half-light of a bored moment at the bar. Sometimes I lapse into idyll, and therefore need to be reminded of my own facticity. A facade of sociality that slips beneath the waves of forgetting, laying bare an iron edifice of fiduciary obligation. There's no more rude awakening than a reminder of our economic trail. I tried to set fire to my icon as though it were a Wicker Man, but the rain put it out. My debts haunt me like a spectre that phases into the corporeal when I need to be disciplined, before disappearing back into the alien unknown. A creature of the imagination hovering on the edge of my peripheral, tinting my vision black when the pain overcomes me out of nowhere. *Don't make me do it. I don't like it any more than you do.* The trace of the way we lived in the world; who we are, best understood as *who we are no longer*. A tether to the past, an unjust fetter, but---let's be honest: have we really changed? Aren't we still the same desperate phylum scrabbling for survival, borrowing money without a plan for how to pay it back, from someone whose memory will always trigger a split dioptre? 

Remember? Remember? She's still there, out of sight but adjacent, still in the same world as you.

*hello*

title: Moving Back and Forth
---

There's no mistaking that going into work feels like shit. I have precious few minutes left. It doesn't feel like death, or suspended animation, but rather like stepping into an alternate reality. I'm not good at moving back and forth, especially when I have low commitment. Maybe that's what valuable in this job: I can be who I want to be; or, who I am: *non-committal*. But that's not who I am! I want to be outgoing, friendly, hilarious...it's just hard when you're always alone.

title: An Impossibly Remote Possibility
---

Felt terrible on Friday night when I learned that F-- made out with the buxom blonde. Felt like such a thing was simply a remote, impossibly remote possibility for me. Felt like no such thing could ever happen to me. And he has a girlfriend. And his girlfriend is also his landlord.

Then I woke up too early, went to work tired, barely tried. Minimal effort because nothing matters.

Waking up hungover and in a state of high emotional stress, I remember that I had a dream that my bike was stolen.

People staring at me like I'm some kind of freak just because I'm sitting on St-Laurent with my shirt open, writing meaningless sentences into a black notebook.

*"He sat in the sun on the concrete steps in front of the hairdresser's, writing in his book before work, shirt open and chest bared to the world."*

*"On pavement steps in front of the *coifferie*, sun on belly-skin, pen on book-skin, counting down the minutes before work, heart open to an alarmed world."*

title: First Memory of Forming Words
---

Idea for a portfolio piece: a short work, almost like a chant, all rhythm, and it is almost entirely questions. Give it some form, but its function is to list everything I know, everything I've ever wanted to learn, everything I've ever asked myself. Give it a kind of chronology, make it also a story of coming-of-age. The questions compound. Start with writing Jack and the Bean-stalk in kindergarten, my first memory of forming words; then copying out *Narnia*; then writing stories and poems to express my sex- and power-fantasies. The poem I wrote about 9/11: *The Usurpers*. Then the unleashing of imagination, in the form of both writing and reading. Musical father, visual mother. Both proletariat. Make the reader feel the sensation of being on the outside. There can also be dialogue, the ultimate signifier of narrative writing.

title: Insufficient Funds II
---

The second (?) time this year I had a transaction declined for insufficient funds. I like that it's a "coffee bar" here [PR]. Has the same set-up as a bar, although I will say that this shade of green is not a pastel....

What else? There's something---to work on...SSHRC, school applications...the first ones are in December. And we also need to work on the APCON essay. Need to start that this week. What do we have? THANKSGIVING, and therefore Indigenous--Settler relations; but also---cosmologies? Truth and reconciliation? That's related to ideas of power, which is another element of the CFP.

There are too many hot chicks here, with too much skin showing. It's hot out today. Mini-heat wave. I overdressed. This is not even to mention the nipples through cheap tank tops.

title: The Rain Theory
---

What are we going to research for the APCON piece?

- Epicurus is the guy responsible for the rain theory (?)
- WHO is the guy responsible for the Eternal Return? I studied this in Falcone's class: does the fact that I cannot immediately recall make me a sub-par student? In a way, it's like learning math: useful to exercise the brain, but made obsolete by the technology of the calculator / the Stanford encyclopedia.
- WHO are we going to cite for the indigenous cosmologies? And what does it even consist of?

The third is supposed to relate to process philosophy. It's a vision of life, the cosmos, as inter-connected movement.

title: What's Happening With M--
---

What's happening with M--? I felt bad right away. Or rather---I feel *scared*. Worried. Concerned that she's going to fall in love. Even as I am absolutely sick with self-loathing, I also know that I have a high power level. How can that be when I am actually so weak? *A pathetic loser*, you might say. I keep getting picked up---picked up off the street like a piece of trash---; and because I am husband material, she begins to think: *this piece of trash is a piece of gold; and he has no other options, therefore I am entitled to him*. I'm easy---the town bicycle. That's what A-- called me once, and it precipitated a big fight with J--, H-- and him. What does it mean for me to say no to someone? It feels impossible. I'm too afraid to hurt their feelings. Too afraid to face another long stretch without touch, attention---a *nut*.

Sitting here. What would C-- or A-- do? The latter is not a role model; the former is like a different species to me.

What would a woman do? They need to learn how to decline offers of sex at some ungodly age. It's pressed on them---it's a kind of threat. Whereas for me, for men, it's an offer---something I want and which feels scarce.

The truth is that, if I were emotionally responsible, I would not have done the hit \& quit.

I'm hard up. And I'm not good at pursuing women I feel an actual interest in.

Now I have to tell her how much I liked her flirting, her attention; but that we are not right for each other....

The Pynchon book, *Gravity's Rainbow*---I think I've lost the plot. Which is weird, given how meticulously plotted it is. It's also very carefully paced, so I'm confident that it will take me by the hand when it needs to.

Everyone at work is being paid to stand around. All the money comes from elsewhere [France]. It's a recession. Maybe we'd have something to do if---

title: Windows Closed, Dust Inside
---

# Sunday

Put off seeing M--. Woke up around 10 with a heavily congested nose. Windows closed, dust inside. Dozed for another hour....then went to M. One coffee not enough. Beauty everywhere. Fuck it.

For the University of Western Ontario, I'm supposed to submit two academic essays. The first can be the last one I wrote for the hauntology class, on the uncanny and the phantasmagoria: it will need to be significantly revised, which will feel good to do, since there's something good there. I know I can make it much better. The challenge will be to integrate more Hegel in a way appropriate to an academic context, but at the same time, to make sure he stays in the background. It's not an essay on Hegel, after all.

[The above entry was written at Reservoir between 14h--15h. I was scheduled for 14h, but there was not enough work so I sat around for an hour. I then walked out and did not return.]

title: "*Action de Grâce*"
---

Slept on the couch because too depressed to go to bed. Only left the house late. How am I going to find a new job? Don't have what it takes to go out looking. I don't have what it takes to go on. *You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on.* I deserve something better: I deserve a job that doesn't make me want to kill myself. Nothing has gotten better. My opportunities have only diminished.

All alone on the *action de grâce*. What should I be thankful for?

- Fit, strong, muscular, as I worked hard to achieve
- Cute enough in the face for some girls to come talk to me
- Good apartment
- Good cat, mostly healthy and generally sweet
- Good hair
- Friends who are nice to me, and with whom I mostly like to spend time. They'll be gone now that I no longer work there.

title: A Red Sign
---

Ile Flotante, Fleurs & Cadeaux, Boxermans, Le plongeoir, Pichai.

*At the gym*---Sometimes an old crush does pass in front of the mirror---behind you but invisible like a spectre.

I thought the fact that my bandanna and her hair were both red was enough of a sign, but as it turns out---

title: What my Voice Reveals
---

When I gave my order to the Olimpi-bro, I could feel the girl in front of me's surprise. My voice reveals something that my visage doesn't: inwardness, infinite inwardness.

- Roseline: 17h
- Buvette chez Simone: 16h
- Taverne Atlantic: 16h
- Pichai: 17h
- Harricana: 12h
- Fleurs & Cadeaux: 17h
- Ile flottante: 17h

*Later, at Bishop*---My diary entries are pretty decent, but I will often just skip over the most important *nouvelles*. Deal with the aftermath, but not dwell or describe the event. I need more description of the world outside myself, to situate things, give a bit of context. In order for this to be a narrative, it needs more dynamism.

Right now I am sitting at Bishop \& Bagg, 1.5 pints deep. I've just finished sending emails to V-- and C--. The first, an apology, as well as an attempt at eroticism. I referred to "her" pussy; asked what she likes; tried to get explicit, to use a few of the magic words.

title: Palestine News
---

Pulled into a sickening loop with Palestine news. Pulled into posting in a manner that is, ultimately, unbecoming.

What should I be working on? The writing prompt for this week is "beyond critique."

- APCON essay
- *Morning Regrets*
- Beneath Language
- MA applications
