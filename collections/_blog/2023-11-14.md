title: Working for Zionists

Saw the very cute girl that I saw here at O several months ago---a few times, even. Here---yesterday, at Pigeon. Didn't talk to her. Too cowardly. She has nice rosy cheeks and a round face. [She was studying something related to theology](/blog#2023-10-14). Very cool, but it's a bad sign that she's at the Israeli restaurant right now.

And that's the other thing, dear diary: I get a job, and of course they're on a BDS list, LOL! My life is a joke. I feel paranoid there. It sucks. Palestine pin on my jacket, keffiyah around my neck. WTF. I'm gonna get fired, and just when I thought I could relax.

The goal is diffuse today. Don't have much of one. I won't return to the APCON essay until Thursday, earliest. I should work on *Beneath Language*, but am not feeling it. What I am feeling is the *Morning* story, which has good parts---I swear to God, there's something there....

The first several paragraphs are decent. One of my ideas for it is to just make it "realistic," i.e. not about anything; or do we prefer instead to make it less realistic, about a guy who is hallucinating? That feels like a conventional twist, but that's a good thing: it's recognizable, and therefore I don't have to work as hard.

The other idea was "campus noir," use a lot of PI tropes, hard-boiled tropes, to develop a "mystery" of existential despair. "Who killed my reason for living," etc. This is a distinctly terrible idea.
