title: New Job is on the BDS List
---

Saw the very cute girl that I saw here at Olimpico several months ago---a few times, even. Here---yesterday, at Pigeon. Didn't talk to her. Too cowardly. She has nice rosy cheeks and a round face. She was studying something related to theology. Very cool. Bad sign that she's at the Israeli restaurant right now.

That's the other thing: I get a job, and of course they're on a BDS list, LOL! I feel paranoid there. It sucks. Palestine pin on my jacket. WTF. I'm gonna get fired, just when I thought I could relax a bit.

Right now, the goal is diffuse. Don't have much of one. I won't return to the APCON essay until Thursday, earliest. I should work on *Beneath Language*, but am not feeling it. What I am feeling is the *Morning* story, which has good parts---it's truly not that bad, at least at first.

Several paragraphs. The idea of just making it "realistic," i.e. not about anything, is not bad---or do we prefer instead to make it about a guy who is hallucinating? That's a pretty conventional twist.

The other idea was "campus noir," use a lot of PI tropes, hard-boiled tropes, to develop a "mystery" of existential despair. "Who killed my reason for living," etc.
