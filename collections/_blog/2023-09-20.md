title: Moving Back and Forth
---

There's no mistaking that going into work feels like shit. I have precious few minutes left. It doesn't feel like death, or suspended animation, but rather like stepping into an alternate reality. I'm not good at moving back and forth, especially when I have low commitment. Maybe that's what valuable in this job: I can be who I want to be; or, who I am: *non-committal*. But that's not who I am! I want to be outgoing, friendly, hilarious...it's just hard when you're always alone.
