title: Moving Back and Forth
---

How does it feel going into work? Like shit, that's for sure. Precious few minutes left. But it doesn't feel like death, or suspended animation; rather, like stepping into an alternate reality. I'm not good at moving back and forth, especially when I have low commitment. But maybe that's what valuable in this job: I can be who I want to be, or, who I am. But that's not who I am. I can be outgoing, gregarious, friendly, hilarious.
