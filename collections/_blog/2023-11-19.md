title: A Good Opportunity
---

What to do...! How am I going to talk to the girl next door...I can offer to give back the papers---then I can ask, well, say that I was so wasted the other night, I could barely speak---but it was so nice to talk to her, to learn a bit about her---the nicest birthday gift of all. I want to learn more about her. Man, this rejection from APCON feels terrible. That and not having a job, both have got me feeling very stressed. Worried. Failure.

Who else published weird little philosophy essays? Who can I send this to? Don't let it go to waste---it needs to go somewhere---a proper literary journal---this is a good opportunity---but it's not important right now. Rather, I need to apply to some jobs.
