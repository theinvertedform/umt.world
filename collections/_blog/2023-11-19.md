title: A Good Opportunity
---

What to do...! How am I going to talk to the girl next door...I can offer to give back the papers---then I can ask, well, say that I was so wasted the other night, I could barely speak---but it was so nice to talk to her, to learn a bit about her---it was the nicest birthday gift of all. It felt like God smiled on me; it felt like the clouds parted, and an angel floated down on a lunar beam. Not just because she is a smiling, cheerful beauty; but because *something happened*. From out of the chaos and turmoil of the world, from out of the constant, impersonal movement of the city, a figure coheres and emerges. I want to learn more about her. 

My *Thanksgiving* essay was rejected by APCON, and I will say that it feels terrible. That and not having a job have got me feeling very stressed. Worried. *Failure*.

Who else publishes weird little philosophy essays? Who can I send this to? Don't let it go to waste---it needs to go somewhere---a proper literary journal---this is a good opportunity---but it's not important right now. The essay is bad, after all, and it's good that it isn't published, because it doesn't cut the mustard. Instead, I need to apply to some jobs.
