*Later, at Bishop*---My diary entries are pretty decent, but I will often just skip over the most important *nouvelles*. Deal with the aftermath, but not dwell or describe the event. I need more description of the world outside myself, to situate things, give a bit of context. In order for this to be a narrative, it needs more dynamism.

Right now I am sitting at Bishop \& Bagg, 1.5 pints deep. I've just finished sending emails to V-- and C--. The first, an apology, as well as an attempt at eroticism. I referred to "her" pussy; asked what she likes; tried to get explicit, to use a few of the magic words.
