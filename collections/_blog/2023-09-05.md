In the VA lunchroom before Erin's first class of the semester. The question that I have right now is, how am I going to keep working? I can't use this time to lose momentum. I need to be sending out pitches: multiple every day, for the Wolfgang review. It can be published anywhere, it just needs to be somewhere (not my website)...

The story we started. Need to finish it. That means push through the drama. This can be pretty long, potentially, but needs to be an actual story with an ending. We need to settle in on whatever themes it wants to unveil. The basic theme is ritual; it's religious in some way or other. Or, it's about a guy who imagines that some form of religiosity would fill the void.

(later) Wow this class is a real sausage fest, LOL More than usual for Erin's classes.. But it's racially diverse. at least.

Being in a strange room. Being next to the queen mother (Erin). It feels very overwhelming. I wonder if I belong here---but based on how many white dudes there are: yes.
