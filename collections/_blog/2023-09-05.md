title: E--'s First Class of the Semester
---

In the VA lunchroom before E--'s first class of the semester. The question weighing on me right now is, how am I going to keep writing? I must not lose momentum. I need to be sending out pitches---multiple every day; for the Wolfgang review, for whatever. Publish it anywhere, so long as it's somewhere (other than my website)...

We need to finish *Morning Regrets*. Push through the drama. There's the potential for it to be pretty long, but it needs to be an actual story. That means an ending, which means *change*. What are the themes it wants to reveal? One basic theme is ritual---it's about a guy who imagines that some form of religiosity would fill the void.

*Later*---Wow, this class is a sausage fest, LOL. More than usual for E--'s classes. At least there's some racial diversity.

Being in a strange room. Being next to the queen mother (E--): it feels very overwhelming. I wonder if I belong here---but based on how many white dudes there are, the answer seems to be yes.

*EV 10.785*

A communist *My Struggle* (Knausgaard).
