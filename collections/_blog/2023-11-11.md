title: It's the Question of Everything
---

Everything is hopeless. No prospects. Everything going downhill.

Working on *Morning Regrets* now, because I feel very emotional and that's all I have.

The key to making this story interesting is to play up the sense of the Block. The reason this character couldn't talk to the girl at the party is actually something very Epic---something high-concept. It's the question of everything. Fictional. Not quotidian.

Hallucinatory. Vision goes black and white. Hearing things, seeing things. Put some more ghosts in there. Skin the cat.

All this writing does is depress me.
