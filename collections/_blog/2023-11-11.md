title: It's the Question of Everything
---

Everything is hopeless. No prospects. Everything going downhill.

Working on *Morning Regrets* now, because I feel very emotional and that's all I have.

The key to making this story interesting is to play up the sense of the Block. Make the reason that he couldn't talk to her something Epic---something high-level. It's the question of everything: not casual by any means, but something high-level-important. Fictional. Not quotidian.

Hallucinatory. Vision goes black and white. Hearing things. Seeing things. Put some more ghosts in there. Skin the cat.

Writing this is immensely depressing.
