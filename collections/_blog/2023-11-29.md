title: The Most Insane Rationalization I Have Ever Indulged In
---

Two days since I gave my number to the girl upstairs. I paced the landing where our two doors let out for ten minutes before J-- knocked for me. When she opened, she was wearing a silk robe and a headscarf; she saw me and looked down at herself as though to say, *well, this is how you have found me, and?* I didn't know what to say---it was one of those comedic moments where the head empties itself and at the crucial moment, all my Works decay, and "Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away" [@poetryfoundation_ozymandias]. She won't be in touch. I know, because---to do so would (a) be too active; and (b) too explicit an admission of interest. When I told her that it was nice to talk to her, she agreed, and I believed her...I believe her now. But she has other things to do; she is not going to be so explicit in signalling her interest. She can't, structurally, logically. It makes no rational sense. If she calls me, if she texts me, that is a clear signal that is active. She is a woman---she is not going to be the active one. She can't. It would be a mistake for her. I don't even want her to: I want her to signal passively that she is interested, but I want to be the one to suggest getting a coffee, or whatever.

Why can't she signal? Because she puts herself in a disadvantageous position. She loses power. She loses her independence. Of course she is not going to call me. The entire structural dynamic is against it: it's not merely that we are neighbours, and therefore there is an inherent risk...all of our meetings, etc are contingent on admitting attraction. I thought there was some admission of attraction when she came into the apartment at 4am and told me her friend had a crush on me...but there was plausible deniability. At this stage, it would only work to move things along by "accident." That is the most frustrating aspect of dating, and I don't know WTF the deal is. 

I think it's something to do with me: there needs to be a subterfuge. There needs to be something else---some excuse. A woman will not simply agree to go out with me; she will not simply admit that she might be attracted to me, will not concede that she wants to know me and be known by me. There needs to be some BS pretense---a network of excuses, justifications, etc. It's quite frustrating. I don't understand it. This whole discussion is upsetting to me: she knows that I am an attractive guy; we have plenty in common---she knows that we work in the same industry, etc. There's a lot of compatibility. She saw the books, the TV, the red flag, the nice interior: she knows that I have tastes and interests and probably feels some curiosity to know more about me---just like I am curious to know about her...but for structural reasons, we never will. Very sad.
