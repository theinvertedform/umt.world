title: I Can't Devote Myself
---

Standing at the bar by the window, a very interesting new place to stand---to wait---at Olimpico. It does allow me to see behind the bar in a way I don't like. I don't like to see Contemporary panting---the pants people think are appropriate to wear at work. I think this counter is supposed to be for friends or something.

Moved up to the window. The only wobbly chair in the house. Next to the *Frankenstein* girl, who is knitting in yellow with a purple hardback notebook in front of her. No copy of Shelley today. According to this very diary, it was back in October that I made note of her.

Trying to read some Baudelaire, but I woke up melancholic. The thing I most want to do is stare into space.

LOL---just read an email from Vera saying she wants to have my baby, pay my student loans, support me as a writer---WTF? I can't devote myself. She also wants me to fall in love with her, make her my wife and keep her in Montr√©al. How insane. I won't be able to devote myself to anyone that I don't fall in love with spontaneously---with whom the early parts of the relationship are adventurous, exciting; Vera does not change my conception of the truth.

Right now, the kinds of emotional truth I feel driven to tell are about being single and alienated; about my past, too. If I fall in love, and get a girlfriend, I will want to tell that kind of truth. The two are (to an extent) mutually exclusive. Can't tell the truth of being single without hurting a relationship. The truth of being lonely, horny; of how one falls into thinking about love...
