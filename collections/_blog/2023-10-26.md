title: Stoic Most Simple
---

Got to get it done today. It's a day of creation---it must be.

Should I peg the new essay on *Killers of the Flower Moon*? Does that make it too similar to the other essay? Or maybe consistency is good? Is it a coincidence that the film was released around Thanksgiving?

- What is the principle of creation for all these cosmos?
  - Stoic most simple: a ring of fire.
  - Thales: world is water, but where does it go?
  - Anaximines: air?
  - Anaximander: void?

We need to transition away from myth, to philosophy?

With respect to the cosmos of the Mound-Builders, there is that example of the earthwork in Peru that we studied once upon a time. An idea that there was a different relation to the Earth vis-a-vis materials. Artefacts are built into the world and are architectural formations?
