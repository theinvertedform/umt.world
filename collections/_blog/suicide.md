Am I suicidal? I think about killing myself often---and talk about it---but mostly in a non-serious way. Now I find myself quite affected by the book *Reader's Block*. I might even say "triggered." I can't stop thinking about the way Hemingway killed himself.

This strikes me as a particularly masculine way of killing oneself. Blowing your head off with a shotgun so your head is ruined, brains and skull splattered all over. Some poor schmuck has to scrape your grey matter from the wall.

Diane Arbus, by contrast, killed herself by slitting her wrists in a bathtub full of water. This is a very feminine, i.e. considerate way to kill oneself. All you need to do is pull the plug and it all drains away.

And here I am thinking about this on a Saturday night. That's what's really alarming. I don't really think about killing myself, but I am forced to consider the ways that I *would* kill myself. I can't get a gun. Don't want to drink poison. Don't have a car. Jumping is always an option, but I don't want it bad enough.

What do I say when I want to kill myself? It's a cry for help. So many of writers killed themselves. Because we are all the most miserable people. Some of them seem happy.
