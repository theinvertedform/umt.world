title: Sick in the Nose
---

Very sore from the workout. Feel bloated and sloppy. Not taking enough time to work on my body. Not enough time for self-care. I'm here at Caffe in gamba, I feel sick, but it's in the nose, not the lungs. Too cold, with the window open at night. My lips are chapped. I'm not taking care of my mouth, face, skin.

Today I need to at least finish *The Truth is Haunted* essay. I should also try to submit it somewhere after. With that many revisions, plus it's something important, I should be able to take care of it.
