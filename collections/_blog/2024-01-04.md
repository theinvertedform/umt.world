title: Sick in the Nose
---

Very sore from the workout. Feel bloated and sloppy. Not taking enough time to care for my body. Not enough time for self-care. I'm here at CG, I feel sick, but it's in the nose, not the lungs. Too cold, with the window open at night. My lips are chapped. I'm not taking care of my mouth, face, skin.

Today I need to at least finish edits to [*The Truth is Haunted*](/the-truth-is-haunted) essay. I should also try to submit it somewhere because it's fucking good. With that many revisions---plus, the topic is genuinely important. The problem with this piece is that it's too academic to be an essay for a general readership; and it's not too entry-level academic to be submitted to a decent peer-reviewed journal. It needs to be either completely re-done for a general audience; or it needs to be actually filled-out, which would take like, two or three times as much space.
