title: What Else Makes me Feel Bad?
---

Nightmare service---WTF so many fuck-ups.  Now I just feel terrible; at Isle de Garde for a beer; Daniella has lost her respect for me...I've lost face. Will I even keep this job? Who knows. The insult added is that the stakes, the fuck-ups, are fractional compared to the past. In the past I've had real responsibility; huge groups in the palm of my hand; an international reputation to uphold...

What else makes me feel bad? In a moment of horniness, I proposed to Vera that we should take a vacation together, and now I will need to tell her that it's a bad idea---or else follow-through with it. I can't tell which is worse.

Can I finish this stupid notebook before the end of the year? I found myself at work fantasizing about Audrey, a girl I have met twice. Fantasizing about being her boyfriend. Sex, yes, making her my slave. Everything I would do to her. I want to unleash the full force of my chi on someone---anyone. No, not anyone, sadly; that's the point. But after work, yes---and we can put our feet up together; suck each other off---she can sit on it, bounce up and down...
