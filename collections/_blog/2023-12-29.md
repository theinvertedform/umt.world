title: What Else Makes me Feel Bad?
---

Nightmare service. So many fuck-ups.  Now I just feel terrible. At IdG for a beer. D-- has lost her respect for me...I've lost face. Will I even keep this job? Who knows. The insult added is that the stakes, the fuck-ups, are fractional compared to the past. In the past I've had real responsibility; huge groups in the palm of my hand; an international reputation to uphold....

What else makes me feel bad? In a moment of horniness, I proposed to V-- that we should take a vacation together, and now I will need to tell her that it's a bad idea---or else follow-through with it. I can't tell which is worse.

Can I finish this stupid notebook before the end of the year? I found myself at work fantasizing about A--, a girl I have met twice. Fantasizing about being her boyfriend. Sex, yes, the process of her becoming my slave. Everything I would do to her. I want a steady girl so that I can begin the process of unleashing the full force of my energy on someone---anyone. No, not anyone, sadly; the sad reality is that my pride holds me back from indulging fully in women that I don't believe are right for me. After work, yes, when it's hot out---and then we can put our feet up together....
