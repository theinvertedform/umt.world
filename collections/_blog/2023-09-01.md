A home for wayward boys, but the plot of land it's on emits a permanent stink....

Colette goes to the bar and knows everyone. I go to the bar and am alone---surrounded, yes, by the sense of vague *connaissance*; but I am---alone. No-one wants to talk to the single white guy, that's for sure.

I am never going to have sex again. The girl who once made conversation looks away awkwardly. I must look really bad. I must smell bad. I must have a terrible aura. What happened to me? I used to be a cool guy. Now I am just sinking deeper and deeper...
