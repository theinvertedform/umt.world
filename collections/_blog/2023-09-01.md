A home for wayward boys, but the plot of land it's on emits a permanent stink....

My sister goes to the bar and knows everyone. I go to the bar and am alone---surrounded, yes, by the sense of vague *connaissance*; but I am ultimately---alone.

The girl who once made conversation looks away awkwardly. I must look really bad. I must smell bad. My pheromones are rank. My aura is giving off invisible stink lines.

Now I'm just sinking---deeper and deeper...
