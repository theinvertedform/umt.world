What are we going to research for the APCON piece?

- Epicurus is the guy responsible for the rain theory (?)
- WHO is the guy responsible for the Eternal Return? I studied this in Falcone's class: does the fact that I cannot immediately recall make me a sub-par student? In a way, it's like learning math: useful to exercise the brain, but made obsolete by the technology of the calculator / the Stanford encyclopedia.
- WHO are we going to cite for the indigenous cosmologies? And what does it even consist of?

The third is supposed to relate to process philosophy. It's a vision of life, the cosmos, as inter-connected movement.

*[I get laid here.]*
