Not the right pen. Wobbly-ass table at Myriade.

1. Introduction with the Winds.
2. Cosmologies. The ones we are accustomed to. Should set up the history of cosmologies, and the dominant concerns.
3. Move into discussion of architecture and earthworks. How the different building styles relate to different worldviews.
4. Story-telling, written vs oral traditions.
5. Appearance vs Reality
6. Thanksgiving
