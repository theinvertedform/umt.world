title: My Mind is Empty
---

The one girl is too young; the other is too powerful.

Now at Bishop \& Bagg. It's quite a privilege to be meeting a woman, even if she's "merely" a friend. Have to remain normal.

Tomorrow, the plan is to---wake up at 8am and walk downtown to the thing. After, go to HOJO to meet the lady. Then go to the gallery, then go to work at the gallery---then go to the gym and do the full-body day. And of course I have to read like 40 pages of Holderlin, or whatever.

My mind is empty right now, other than the stupid anxiety of whether or not my friend is actually going to make it. The whole thing is BS. But it's the price I pay for her friendship, I guess---the anxiety of not knowing whether she can follow through. She's still very powerful. But what else...
