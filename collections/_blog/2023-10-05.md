Need to come up with some ideas for the APCON essay:

- Rotate between 3 different cosmologies. Make them all set on a rainy night, some time in far antiquity.

1. Indigenous cosmologies [relational, processual, pragmatic]
2. Circle [Eternal Return, the default and most basic cosmology]
3. Rain [Epicurus / clinamen / after Althusser, the de facto cosmology of Marxism]

The goal is to come up with a narrative that explores how each one is [bad/God]. We can rotate through each one in an order---give it a nice, easily-legible structure; make each segment a similar length. Make the stories very similar. Maybe we can have an introduction / closing paragraph that spells things out, so that it's more essay-like.

Don't pass judgement, that's lame. Each one has its place, each one does its work. Erin passes judgement, but that's her prerogative, not mine.

We do kind of want to bring things to the present, in order to show how these things develop into the world's pain. Into toxic coping habits. Althusser shoots his wife in the head.

It needs to be more Thanksgiving-y. We can do that by hyping up the seasonal change. We can also try to account for---power dynamics between these traditions?
