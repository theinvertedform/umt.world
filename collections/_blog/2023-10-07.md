title: What's Happening With Milly
---

What's happening with Milly. I felt bad right away. Or rather, I feel scared. Worried. Concerned that she is going to fall in love. Because my power level is so high. Except---I am actually very weak. A pathetic loser, you might say. I am picked up by anyone. I keep getting picked up, and because I am husband material, her expectation becomes something. Or, that's how I feel. I project. I keep getting picked up: I'm easy. The town bicycle. That's what A--called me once. What does it mean for me to say no to someone? Seems impossible. Too afraid to hurt their feelings. Too afraid to face another long stretch without touch, attention, a nut.

Sitting here. What would C-- or A--do? The latter is not a role model; the former is like a different species to me.

What would a woman do? They need to learn how to decline offers of sex at some ungodly age. Because it's pressed on them: it's a kind of threat. Whereas for me, for men, it's an offer---something I want; feel like I can't get; but also, the fact that I don't want to date her.

The truth is that, if I were emotionally responsible, I would not have done the hit + quit.

Sadly, the fact is that I'm hard up. And I'm not good, still, at pursuing relationships with women I feel a true interest in.

So now, in my position, I have to tell her how much I liked her flirting, her attention; but that we are not right for each other...

The Pynchon book, GR---I may have lost track of the plot to some degree. The thing is so carefully plotted that, well, it's also very carefully paced. I know it will take me by the hand when it needs to.

Everyone at work is being paid to stand around. All the money comes from elsewhere [France]. It's a recession. Maybe we'd have something to do if---
