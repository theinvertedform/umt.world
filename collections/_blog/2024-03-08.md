title: Elbows on the Counter

I love how high up the counter by the window at O is. Yesterday I had a terrible crash during training: no energy, no more sugar to keep my going. I have to return to basic principles. One foot in front of another. I am nothing like these people. I haven't dedicated enough time. My craft is nowhere near as good. Needs more of a STORY. A narrative with twists and turns. Maybe with a perspective less tied to my own. The K-- story---that's what we're building towards. Everything else is practise.
