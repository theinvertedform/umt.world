title: What I'm Building Towards
---

I love how high up the counter by the window at O is. Yesterday I had a terrible crash during training: no energy, no more sugar to keep my going. I have to return to basic principles: walking begins with putting one foot in front of the other. I am nothing like these people I'm reading, or the ones I'm competing against: I haven't put in enough time! My craft is nowhere near as good. Needs more STORY. A narrative with twists and turns. Maybe a perspective more interesting than my own. The K-- story---that's what we're building towards. Everything else is practise, and I need so much of it.
