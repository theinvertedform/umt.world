title: "*Action de Grâce*"
---

Slept on the couch because too depressed to go to bed. Only left the house late. How am I going to find a new job? Don't have what it takes to go out looking. I don't  have what it takes. But I deserve something better. I deserve a job where I actually have something to do. Nothing has gotten better. My employment opportunities have only diminished.

All alone on the *action de grâce*. What should I be thankful for?

- Fit, strong, muscular, as I worked hard to achieve.
- Cute enough in the face for some girls to come talk to me.
- Good apartment.
- Good cat, mostly healthy and generally sweet.
- Good hair.
- Friends who are nice to me, and with whom I mostly like to spend time. They'll be gone now that I no longer work there.
