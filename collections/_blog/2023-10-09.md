title: "*Action de Grâce*"
---

Slept on the couch because too depressed to go to bed. Only left the house late. How am I going to find a new job? Don't have what it takes to go out looking. I don't have what it takes to go on. *You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on.* I deserve something better: I deserve a job that doesn't make me want to kill myself. Nothing has gotten better. My opportunities have only diminished.

All alone on the *action de grâce*. What should I be thankful for?

- Fit, strong, muscular, as I worked hard to achieve
- Cute enough in the face for some girls to come talk to me
- Good apartment
- Good cat, mostly healthy and generally sweet
- Good hair
- Friends who are nice to me, and with whom I mostly like to spend time. They'll be gone now that I no longer work there.
