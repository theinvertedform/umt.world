title: The Ecstasy of Optimism
---

Ecstasy of optimism. A good lead, a possibility. Hope. The ecstasy of hope. Hits like crack; it's amazing. Light, buoyant; feels like I'm floating on air. There's a storm-cloud, which is the fact that I haven't even done my trial shift. They have infinite options.

The Concordia letter needs a section on my academic diversity of knowledge, etc. This should go into the part where I talk about---my genre. How my genre is informed by my background. I'm trying to bring together a wide range of different knowledges to develop this one very cool practise.

The Western letter needs to reference somebody---that's basically the piece missing.
