title: The Ecstasy of Optimism
---

A bit of encouragement from the world hits the brain like a chemical injection. The ecstasy of optimism. A good lead, a possibility: an interview that went well, at a restaurant and for a *patron* that I recognize as being at the level of service that I am used to. *Hope*. Hits like an amazing drug. Light, buoyant. It feels like I'm floating on air. There's a storm-cloud, which is the fact that I haven't even done a trial shift. They have infinite options. Still: when I left, I rushed around the corner, fell to me knees on the asphalt lot there, faced east and the low fence of a socialized housing block, and said a prayer.

My Concordia letter of application needs a section on the diversity of my academic knowledge, etc. This should go into the part where I talk about---my genre. How my genre is informed by my background. I'm trying to bring together a wide range of different knowledges to develop one *very cool* practise.

The Western letter needs to reference some of their faculty---that's the main piece missing.
