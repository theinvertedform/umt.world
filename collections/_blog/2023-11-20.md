Here I am at Dispatch, and the girl that I asked so many people to help me find is here. Will I have the courage to approach her? After having hyped it up so much? I can't ask her out right now, I can't---no way.

What is my plan? Walk back up St-Laurent to the package store; then to Popeye's, then to---various bars along Mont-Royal?

I'm frozen here. I can't move. Too afraid to approach her, and too afraid to leave without approaching her. Maybe I should just stay here forever. My old boss, Gabe, just walked by---what a prick. Man I feel very stressed out right now.
