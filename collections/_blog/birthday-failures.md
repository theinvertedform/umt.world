The part itself was a failure: many of the people who said they would attend didn't; there were a few new friends, but attendance in general was down from my Christmas party last year. No-one expected food, no-one ate except for the cookies.

I thought there was a moment of success at the end of the night, but it turns out that it was just another failure. Coming back from the bar after last call, I ran into the upstairs neighbour. Beautiful and cheerful, she felt safe enough to come inside my apartment at 4am and have a smoke. Told me that her old roommate---the one with the dog---had had a crush on me. Her presence was like a joyful ray of sunlight in the darkness. Warm, cheerful, bubbly. I was too wasted to make a move---could barely even hold on a conversation---but that would have been too sudden, anyway.

That felt like a win: for about 24 hours, I was riding high on that one encounter, which lasted maybe 15 minutes. Then---Saturday morning, I got the rejection letter from APCON. I knocked on the door and gave back a pack of rolling papers, knowing they weren't hers but wanting to use it as an excuse to re-initiate contact. The blonde answered, as ever; and visibly unhappy about being disturbed.
