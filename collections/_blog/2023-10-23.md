If we are going to discuss Indigenous philosophy, we should also discuss written versus oral language. For Glissant, this is at the heart of the conflict between the colonizer and the colonized.

Monuments are a means to facilitate inter/intra-tribal social/economic/ideological organization. They are sites of liturgy, i.e. public ritual; they use repetitive models that are easy to understand. Their construction depends on co-operation that implies complex micro- and macro-societies.

These monuments are ritual sites that hold sacred objects, as well as food. People lived on-site sometimes. Monuments mark local resources, and people were expected to regularly return to the site. (111--112)

*Use old-fashioned words like "league."*
