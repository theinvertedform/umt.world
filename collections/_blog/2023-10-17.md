title: I Must Cut Down the Narrative of my Body
---

In the *Beneath Language* story, all the stuff about being adjacent to the customers is extra. There might be something there, since it's adjacent to a body---it's in the narrative of my body. Whatever that means...

...but it's extra. I need to cut it down. Make it sound better. Less repetitive, more structured. More of the imagery. Make it make more sense. Make sure the reader can follow.

Somehow, this afternoon coffee has made me feel worse.
