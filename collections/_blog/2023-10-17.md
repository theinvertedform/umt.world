title: I Must Cut Down the Narrative of my Body
---

In the Beneath Language story, all the stuff about being adjacent to the customers is extra. There might be something there, since it's adjacent to a body---it's in the narrative of my body. Whatever that means---but it's extra. There should be some kind of way to cut it down. Make it sound better. Make it fit more. Make it less repetitive. More of the imagery. Make it make more sense. Make sure the reader can follow.

Somehow that afternoon coffee made me feel worse.
