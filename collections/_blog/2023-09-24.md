Felt terrible on Friday night when I learned that Felix made out with the buxom blonde. Felt like such a thing was simply a remote, impossibly remote possibility for me. Felt like no such thing could ever happen to me. And he has a girlfriend. And his girlfriend is his landlord.

Then I woke up too early, went to work tired, barely tried. Such minimal effort. Nothing matters. Well, at this job at least.

What else. On this morning, waking up hungover and in a state of high emotional stress, I remember that I had a dream that my bike was stolen.

People staring at me like I'm some kind of freak. Just because I'm sitting on St-Laurent with my shirt open, writing meaningless sentences into a black notebook.

"He sat in the sun on the concrete steps in front of the hairdresser's, writing in his book before work, shirt open and chest bared to the world."

"On pavement steps in front of the coifferie, sun on belly skin, pen on skin of book, counting down the minutes before work, open heart to the world."
