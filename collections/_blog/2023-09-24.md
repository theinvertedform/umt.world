title: An Impossibly Remote Possibility
---

Felt terrible on Friday night when I learned that F-- made out with the buxom blonde. Felt like such a thing was simply a remote, impossibly remote possibility for me. Felt like no such thing could ever happen to me. And he has a girlfriend. And his girlfriend is also his landlord.

Then I woke up too early, went to work tired, barely tried. Minimal effort because nothing matters.

Waking up hungover and in a state of high emotional stress, I remember that I had a dream that my bike was stolen.

People staring at me like I'm some kind of freak just because I'm sitting on St-Laurent with my shirt open, writing meaningless sentences into a black notebook.

*"He sat in the sun on the concrete steps in front of the hairdresser's, writing in his book before work, shirt open and chest bared to the world."*

*"On pavement steps in front of the *coifferie*, sun on belly-skin, pen on book-skin, counting down the minutes before work, heart open to an alarmed world."*
