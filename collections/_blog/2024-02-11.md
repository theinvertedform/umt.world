title: Increasing the Odds
---

Failed to ask out A-- again---spoke to the guys at PR about it a bit, and had a beer---now back to just being alone, I guess? *Comme toujours*.

It's a question of chance---luck---which means my best bet is to simply increase my chances---increase my odds---that's all I can do. Yes there is an element of chance, but as the Agent of Law (the man), it is also on me to make things happen. My responsibility is to make the world conform to a vision. It's all on me---poor little pond scum.
