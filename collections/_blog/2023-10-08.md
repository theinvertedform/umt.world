title: Windows Closed, Dust Inside
---

Put off seeing M--. Woke up around 10 with a heavily congested nose. Windows closed, dust inside. Dozed for another hour....then went to M. 1 coffee not enough. Beauty everywhere.

For [University of Western Ontario], I am supposed to submit 2 academic essays. 1 can be the last one I wrote for May [on the uncanny and the phantasmagoria]: it will need to be significantly revised, which will feel good to do, since there's such a strong seed there. I know I can make it much better. The challenge will be to integrate more Hegel in a way appropriate to an academic context; and at the same time, to downplay it. It's not an essay about Hegel---that's not the main idea, just the background.

[The above entry was written at Reservoir between 14h--15h. I was scheduled for 14h, but there was not enough work so I sat around for an hour. I then walked out and did not return.]
