title: Everyone has the Advantage
---

Unbelievably depressed this morning. No hope. I am a complete failure. Nothing but failure. No hope. Got to get on welfare. No woman ever again. Nothing. I am nothing, I will never be anything. I am a failure. I am a total failure. I give up, I give up. It's hopeless. Fail, constant fail, never-ending fail. Rejection without end; rejection on rejection. Inescapable loop, stuck forever. Nothing will get better, everything will always get worse. No prospects, just nothing for ever and ever. Failures pile up, I am alone, I will always be alone, I will be alone forever, failing. Nothing but void, darkness, hopelessness, failure. Nothing to look forward to. I feel bad that my cat and my roommates have to suffer my presence; I would never dare, I would never presume to inflict my presence on a woman.

Everyone has the advantage. I have the disadvantage. I am a fucking failure. I should kill myself.
