The second (?) this year I had a transaction declined for insufficient funds. I like that it's a "coffee bar" here [Pastel Rita]. Has the same set-up as a bar, although I will say that this shade of green is not a pastel....

What else? There's something---to work on...SSHRC, school applications...the first ones are in December. And we also need to work on the APCON essay. Need to start that this week. What do we have? THANKSGIVING, and therefore Indigenous--Settler relations; but also, cosmologies? Truth + reconciliation? That's related to ideas of power, which is another element of the CFP.

There are too many hot chicks here, with too much skin showing. It's hot out today. Mini-heat wave. I overdressed. Not to mention the nipples through thin tank tops.
