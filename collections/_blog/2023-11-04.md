title: A Single Rotation of the Moon
---

There is that idea in *Cave of Forgotten Dreams* that societies and cultures that do not have writing live outside of history; ten thousand years is the same as a single rotation of the moon.

*creation story* <--> *architecture* <--> *time* / Thanksgiving

The theme of Thanksgiving is the significant part that's still missing. A paragraph at the beginning and end where I speak in the first person. I say *my* relation to the topics at hand; my relationship to colonialism and whiteness. It's my place to say what and who I am thankful for. Something sincere and real. Break form.
