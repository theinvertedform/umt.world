title: Associated Cosmologies
---

Need more imagery: need to kick it off with some literary wonder. We can start with the mystical grandeur of Indigenous monuments, then get into the associated cosmologies. Then go into Western cosmologies---Doric columns---the naive smile. The childhood phase of the West. Get into the two contrasting visions of the universe.

We need to make the Thanksgiving theme more explicit. And the theme of power...? Monuments are sites of power, for sure.
