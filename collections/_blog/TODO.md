# Design and Structure

The literary structure of the diary has so far been informed by the technical structure of the blog. As this diary is trying more to resemble fiction, the design and architecture for this page has changed.

Now, instead of a rolling list of posts, entries are edited into chapters. The chapters will appear in the table of contents in ascending chronological order. This is significant, since it is literally the opposite direction of typical blog pages.

The chapters will have titles, but their order is expected to change. They will have a preamble, which is a hyperlinked sub-TOC, as in *Blood Meridian* a centred paragraph block. Each entry will be a subsection whose title is the day of the week of the post (a style taken from Gombrowicz's *Diaries*). Centred, italics; their URL structure will be the same as it currently is, but we will add a URL format for the chapters. We also need some kind of graphic to finish sections, so the transition isn't so harsh.

# Content

The structure of the chapters themselves will be chosen from internal dynamics of the narrative. We are going to vastly reduce the number of entries; we are going to condense things, and also add descriptions to give something interesting. We might also include film diary entries, or at least occasional excerpts, for extra dynamism.

We are going to begin by trying to craft what we have into something. This chapter begins in September, and goes until October 7. We can incorporate the writing for Erin's class.
