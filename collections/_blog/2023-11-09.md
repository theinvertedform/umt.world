title: Perfect Italian-style Foam
---

At Felice. New guy is talking about Ezra Pound with one of his regular--friends. I have a training shift for a full-time job as a server. The saucer under the coffee cup is filthy; the bottom of the cup is filthy because the grill of the espresso machine is filthy. I will concede that the milk is perfect Italian-style foam.

Right now, the goal is very modest. It's 11:43 am; if I say until 12:45, I can be on the gym floor by 1, then hopefully out by 3pm. Go home just long enough to drop off things, then bike to the place. Bring book + notebook, and afterwards I am permitted to get a drink.
