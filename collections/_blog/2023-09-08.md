Goal right now: respond to Vera's email. Send the pitch to at least one more place.

Can't do the latter. Difficult enough to do the former. Too distracted by thoughts of girls. The desire for love. Oh, how I desire to love and to be loved. And yet, I am not available to women. They simply don't know about me. I am not there. No-one cares. I'm not attractive: I'm ugly, I have no friends, I'm a loser, no-one desires me; I will never be desired.

The next project, for this weekend, is to pitch the Wolfgang review to at least 3 places. Emails to be sent out on Monday. Start pitching it indiscriminately: a 1k word column. That's all I want to show for it. Something short, funny, sassy, that people will read. Will want to read. Just 1k words.

Just before 16h---Everything futile. No chances. Nothing but sadness, loneliness. Life of the modern gymcel. Life of the modern man. I should go back to l'Esco and tell that girl the truth: that I liked the look in her eyes. I liked the way they flashed in that brief moment, as she was dodging between drunks\ [at the Monsoon show]. Couldn't stop thinking about it, and even though we are very far away from each other---it made me want to know her more. C[hristine] and J[ules]: my two great loves that never were.

'Round about minuit---Maybe if I wear more tonal outfits, like the cowboy white-hat on the couch opposite me, here, now, at Casa del popolo. Maybe if I had bigger side and rear delts, relative to my front, I could find someone to love. Maybe if I used sunscreen in the morning, so my face was less wrinkly, I would find someone to love. Maybe If I was one degree higher in my profession. Maybe if I actually got through the {Phenomenology of Spirit] a second time.

Somehow I have to stop thinking about this. Somehow, learn to be happy as is: alone, sexless.

What else am I supposed to do? Write the review on spec? Move on to something else? I really wanted to write it as one of those great, propulsive little pieces of writing---one of those funny, smart, touching, short little reviews that you read sometimes. Not often. A little snapshot of life.

My relationship to women is 100% parasocial. Few friends, few real interactions; instead, just---the hot girls I ogle at work. The hot girls I look at at their jobs. Is this better or worse than an app? Is it the same? Bars, fake second spaces, are there; apps are not there. Therefore, the VIA NEGATIVA is to NOT introduce a new element. Happiness (wife) will be found by removing everything until only she remains.

Seeing Em last week; seeing Jules and her Lil' Peep boyfriend today; next time, it will be Christine---or more likely, Rachelle. Maybe Alisha is back in town. How did [seeing Em] make me feel?

Basically, I know that we are compatible. I would bet my testicles on it. She has precisely what I need, which is a connection to the earth. I have what she needs---a water depth. We are both graves to each other. I know with the certainty of conviction that either of these 3 women would be good for me. I had a chance...when I see these girls, I think of the way my life could have gone. I see---the opportunity I let pass me by.

I'm going to call it. Throw in the towel. Ha, ha. What a joke. The very notion that I would give up on romance. I would die before ending a romance prematurely (whatever that means). KMS. Every last poison drop. Wring the fruit until nothing is left, even if it kills me. Kill me. I will die for a love that does not exist.

Later, in front of La Rama [around 2am]---What's the idea with the writing? I have nothing else to do...The taste of tequila is still on my lips, stronger than this nice beer I have.

One thing: I learned her [girl from l'Esco] name. Lydia. That never would have happened if Daniella had not been there. If not for her---well, who knows. I would not have been able to ask. But I did have the opportunity to learn, and I learned that she has a boyfriend.

Describe her: Lydia, bartender and "technical director" at l'Esco. Loose cuff on synthetic black pants; cheap, beat up running shoes. A grey t-shirt hangs over a barely-perceptible protrusion of breasts. Small, like her ass and her narrow hips. Not my kind of woman. Just a woman. The most feminine element of her appearance is her hair. Long, wavy, down past the shoulders, just the tips holding on to the remainder of a blonde dye job.
