title: Notes on *Morning Regrets*
---

The story becomes something else when it moves into a closer analysis of the class society. The problem here is that it's disconnected. If we can get it to the point where it's just doing a serviceable job of describing the characters and social dynamics, then I can add in---more hallucinations? We should have something that brings us back to the morning of waking up.

Okay, here's the key thing: you put her name into the computer 3 times, and eventually find her. That's the magic element, perhaps. That's the story of the morning. It ends with me and her engaging in a dialogue. Fantasy, or banal reality? I think that gives us a better shot of ending on a joke. The Hegelian love story is not a part of it; that can be removed.

- Wake up depressed
- Remember the party from night prior
- Setting of the Hegel class
- Discussion of sense-certainty with J-- and E--
- Vera, guilt
- Society of the Hegel class

We need a better structure for moving through time. We need more to happen on the first day: everything else is a recollection. That's the present of the story. We need two events more to happen: the general theme is anchorage, or lack thereof. So one can be work: in that moment, our hero is in the limbo at the end of classes, before graduation, and without a job. Or, rather, that is the precise moment when I would be doing my first trial shift at Reservoir. So maybe, in a desperate moment before work, I enter her name into the computer for the second time.

1. In bed, unable to move
2. Before work, feeling completely useless
3. Before bed, buzzed?

That's basically enough of a plot. We don't need noir tropes. Now we just need---well, are we making him some kind of hallucinatory guy? What's the story hook? Whether or not to---whether this guy is crazy? I guess the story hook is whether or not she actually did recognize him.

As an epilogue, we can talk about seeing her at the reading, and constantly moving to keep a distance. Then, seeing her and the Lil' Peep BF out the window. Basically, despite the rejection, there is still this unknowability (opacity); still an element of Schrodinger's love affair. But we have to put this into relation, or into Hegelian terms. Actuality vs. ???

It's fantasy to think that there is a possibility of things continuing. We have to end, after finding her profile online, on an unambiguous note of rejection. However, maybe when looking in the mirror, there is the possibility of things going another way. We don't know---we can never know. Whether she was attracted to me in that moment. The point is that there is a POSSIBILITY! And also the sense of being recognized, being seen.
