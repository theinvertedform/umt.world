On 31 August 2023, *Apocalypse Confidential* published their third special of the year: [DUST---JOHN FORD AND THE SPACE AGE](). I submitted an essay written specifically in response to the theme proposal. *Light Enough to Burn a Hole in the Sun*, a title I came up with early in the writing process and thought was good enough to not worry about changing, was written over roughly two weeks towards the end of August. Possibly a week before that was spent gestating. I had only heard about the publication in the month or so prior. My memory is that I saw an old crush tweeting about them, but it's possible that is a fabulation and I found them through conventional means (i.e. I was presented with a stranger tweeting about them). The memory is hazy enough that it could go either way. However, from the outset, APCON stood apart in my mind as a venue worthy of my esteem through this initial association.

The second association was my friend Chuck, who stayed with me during the final week of writing, telling me about Anna Krivolapova. Her collection of short stories will be released by the publishing arm of Apocalypse Confidential this autumn. Chuck spoke highly of her, and I think highly of him. Two elements that boost the esteem of this publication in my mind. I went so far as to go through their website archives, and to read several pieces in order to get a sense of just what the project consists of. The combination of these initial associations, and the style of the call for submissions, led me to put a lot of energy into the essay I wrote for them. I am quite proud of it: finally, it feels like I am working the genre I want to. Finally, I am able to break free from the prison of academic style; to paint a picture, while also trying to address serious philosophical questions. A question that preoccupies me quite a bit, in fact.

One major element of the "literary" philosophical essay style, in my mind, is referencing things without necessarily providing citations. It would not have fit the "epic" voice I was going for to provide in-text citations. Here is a list of all the things I am aware of having woven into the fabric of the text.

1. The protagonist of the essay is Spirit; taken, of course, from Hegel. In the sense I am using it in the essay, it is intended to refer to the general movement of social history. "Spirit" is "history as it has developed so far."

	> Spirit is thus self-supporting, absolute, real being. All previous shapes of consciousness are abstract forms of it. They result from Spirit analysing itself, distinguishing its moments, and dwelling for a while with each. This isolating of those moments *presupposes* Spirit itself and subsists therein; in other words, the isolation exists only in Spirit which is a concrete existence. ... we may briefly recall this aspect of them in our own reflection: they were consciousness, self-consciousness, and Reason. ... as unity of consciousness and self-consciousness, Spirit is consciousness that *has Reason* ... when this Reason which Spirit *has* is intuited by Spirit as Reason that *exists*, or as Reason that is *actual* in Spirit and is its world, then Spirit exists in its truth; it *is* Spirit, the *ethical* essence that has an *actual* existence. --- [@hegel1977, 264--265 / M440]

2. The central image of the essay is a drill boring through to the core of the earth. I am quite sure that I started writing before Charles spoke about re-watching [*The Core*](https://letterboxd.com/aoy2k/film/the-core/activity/), and this image was there from the outset. The association between "modernism" and "drilling, digging, excavating" is a common one that I could not give a single citation for. However, I realized only last week that I owe a greater debt to Glissant and his *Poetics of Relation* than I think I had previously realized.

	> Poetics of depth. Baudelaire explored the early realms of this form of poetics. The vertiginous extension, not out into the world but toward the abysses man carries within himself. Western man essentially, that is, who at that moment in time governed the evolution of modernity and provided its rhythm. Inner space is as infintely explorable as spaces of the earth. At the same time as he discovered the numerous varieties of the species man constituted, he felt that the alleged stability of knowledge led nowhere and that all he would ever know of himself was what he made others know. As a result, Baudelaire quashed romantic lyricism's claim that the poet was the introspective master of his joys or sorrows; and that it was in his power to draw clear, plain lessons from this that would benefit everyone. This romantic beautitude was swept away by the stenches inseperable from Baudelairean carrion. --- [@glissant1997, 24]

3. The next image is the idea of Azathoth, the lord of all the Outer Gods in Lovecraft's Cthulhuverse, sitting at the centre of the world. I started off with the image of Spirit in a drill, digging deep to the centre of the earth, but this was a very significant adductive leap that came on early in the process. I'm not sure which Lovecraft story I read this in---it may be that I only read the Wikipedia article some time ago---but some neuron fired, some crepuscular ray hit me, and I remembered that Azathoth was called the "Nuclear God." As Charles mentioned, this is quite simply an archaic use of the word "nuclear" to mean "at the centre of things," but given that I was writing about *Oppenheimer* and the photo of the Trinity test, it truly felt like divine inspiration.

	> Never was a sane man more dangerously close to the arcana of basic entity—never was an organic brain nearer to utter annihilation in the chaos that transcends form and force and symmetry. I learned whence Cthulhu first came, and why half the great temporary stars of history had flared forth. I guessed—from hints which made even my informant pause timidly—the secret behind the Magellanic Clouds and globular nebulae, and the black truth veiled by the immemorial allegory of Tao. The nature of the Doels was plainly revealed, and I was told the essence (though not the source) of the Hounds of Tindalos. The legend of Yig, Father of Serpents, remained figurative no longer, and I started with loathing when told of the monstrous nuclear chaos beyond angled space which the Necronomicon had mercifully cloaked under the name of Azathoth. It was shocking to have the foulest nightmares of secret myth cleared up in concrete terms whose stark, morbid hatefulness exceeded the boldest hints of ancient and mediaeval mystics. Ineluctably I was led to believe that the first whisperers of these accursed tales must have had discourse with Akeley’s Outer Ones, and perhaps have visited outer cosmic realms as Akeley now proposed visiting them.

4. The next important ingredient is the photo of the Trinity test. This is also one of the few things that I started off knowing that I wanted to write about. Is the essay more a review of *Oppenheimer*, or more an analysis of this photo? You may notice that the colophon for this website is the "dark protozoic organism" that represents an "absence of medium." It has been my banner image for years. I lifted it from ARTH 367: Postmodern Photography, a course I took in Winter 2018, led by Tal-Or Ben-Choreen. As I recall, she used it in the context of discussing what constitutes art: is this photo, taken for mechanical/scientific purposes, an artwork? She and I both stole it from [*The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-first-light-of-the-trinity-atomic-test), which remains the only source for the image online (as far as I can tell). I revisited the article in writing my essay, and it appears to be a review of *American Prometheus*, the book that *Oppenheimer* is based on. Coincidence upon coincidence. I have not now and did not then read this article, only scrolled to steal the photo (in the pdf I submitted to APCON, I included a caption with citation details).

5. Past the halfway point, I added in yet another metaphor: the core of the earth is a "hollow world," where cro-magnon man stalks pre-historic creatures. This is another fantasy image that I feel is so generic I don't have a specific reference for. However, I believe that it ultimately comes from something-or-other by Edgar Rice Burroughs (most famous as the creator of Tarzan and Conan). Like the Lovecraft, another inheritance from my father. As a teenager, I used to write stories set at the core of the world about a pirate ornithopter, as big as a frigate, crewed by an assortment of intelligent animals. The main character was Hrothgrar, an "albino spirit bear," whose name is an osmotic corruption of the Norse god Hrothgar (what happens when you spend your preteen years reading *Bulfinch's*). A combination of Redwall and Elric of Melniboné. The idea was that, spirit bears being all white, the albino version would be all black; and, spirit bears being the most rare type of bear, their culture would be highly refined: the wizards of bears. But my Hrothgrar, being an albino (the inverted form), would be huge and inarticulate, showing the influence of yet another childhood favourite: The Incredible Hulk.

6. "The layers of the earth weigh on Spirit's head like a nightmare" is a spin on Marx's famous line from a pamphlet published in 1852.

	> Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past. **The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living.** And just when they seem engaged in revolutionising themselves and things, in creating something entirely new, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names, battle slogans and costumes in order to present the new scene of world history in this time-honoured disguise and this borrowed language. Thus Luther donned the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789 to 1814 draped itself alternately as the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to parody, in turn, 1789 and the revolutionary tradition of 1793 to 1795. In like manner the beginner who has learnt a new language always translates it back into his mother tongue, but he has assimilated the spirit of the new language and can produce freely in it only when he moves in it without remembering the old and forgets in it his ancestral tongue.

7. The reference to "conquering reason" is an explicit reference to Glissant, who is himself referencing Deleuze \& Guattari.

>Summarizing what we know concerning the varieties of identity, we arrive at the following:
>
>*Root identity*
>
>- is founded in the distant past in a vision, a myth of the creation of the world;
>- is sanctified by the hidden violence of a filiation that strictly follows from this founding episode;
>- is ratified by a claim to legitimacy that allows a community to proclaim its entitlement to the possession of a land, which thus becomes a territory;
>- is preserved by being projected onto other territories, making their conquest legitimate---and through the project of a discursive knowledge.
>
>Root identity therefore rooted the thought of self and of territory and set in motion the thought of the other and of voyage.
>
>*Relation identity*
>
>- is linked not to a creation of the world but to the conscious and contradictory experience of contacts among cultures;
>- is produced in the chaotic network of Relation and not in the hidden violence of filiation;
>- does not devise any legitimacy as its guarantee of entitlement, but circulates, newly extended;
>- does not think of a land as a territory from which to project toward other territories but as a place where one gives-on-and-with rather than grasps
>
>Relation identity exults the thought of errantry and of totality. --- [@glissant1997, 143--144]


8. The idea of climbing up the sides of the ziggurat to become one with the sun is an image I have been playing with for a while. It's in another piece of writing that I am currently working on. It's vaguely a reference to Aztec cultures, more so than to Early Dynasty Egypt, before they figured out how to make pyramids. I worry that it might be racist, but it's also perhaps my favourite image in the entire thing. I will be using it again, that's for sure.
