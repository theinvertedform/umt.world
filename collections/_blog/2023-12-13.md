title: Power, Recognition, Presence
---

Went to McK, felt foolish for thinking I had a connection to the place. I wanted to give J-- one of their shirts for Christmas as a token of me, a sign of an accomplishment that I was proud of (holding down that job for about 3.5 months). The place is so massive, institutional, busy, powerful. My time there didn't make a dent, even though it made a huge dent in me. 

Walked by Hard Knox, thought about R--, put up an "I <3 Hamas" sticker. The Sud-Ouest is the lair of my enemy and I don't belong there. I felt invisible, like no-one---like no-one knows me. Zero power, zero recognition, zero presence. Doesn't help that I invited a bunch of people to the party, and few responded. Now I'm going to try to write?! It's so late in the day....
