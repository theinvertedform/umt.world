title: Power, Recognition, Presence
---

Went to McKiernan's, felt foolish for thinking I had a connection to the place. Walked by Hard Knox and put up an "I <3 Hamas" sticker. Felt invisible, like no-one---like no-one knows me. Zero power, zero recognition, zero presence. Doesn't help that I invited a bunch of people to the party, and few responded. Now I'm going to try to write?! It's so late in the day...
