title: More Spring for the Present
---

Bunch of chicks at CG, all speaking English loudly. To some extent, things have taken a turn for the better. Next step: girlfriend!!

For the story...

- Need to make the timeline more clear. More Spring for the present moments; more weather.
- How does the V-- story relate to anything? How does anything relate to anything? The theme is...fixating on the unobtainable, in spite of what's in front of you. Or something.
- The last thing is adding in the thing about "praying," entering J--' name into the phone 3 times. It can end there. Make it happy. Or, tell the truth and don't mislead the reader?
