title: Halloween is One Year
---

Wake up feeling terrible. Halloween is one year. What progress have I made? Had sex with three girls, all of whom are beneath me...but ultimately I'm just as alone as ever. I am making no progress on actually finding my own way in the world. This is not to mention the professional woes---no job, no job, a deadbeat!

Girl next to me is reading *Frankenstein*. Me doing nothing. I have decent strength for my technique, which is quite rigorous. I have a decent amount of muscle.
