title: Prayerful Insertions of the Name
---

Sent the letters. Today is about receiving feedback from Stephen, and about working on the story. *The Path to Self-Consciousness*. The main thing, of course, is to insert the prayerful insertions of the name into the computer; to be ended on the moment of sending her a message. Wow. Of course, it should have been on Twitter, which is the website that I actually use.
