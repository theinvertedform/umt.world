title: Prayerful Insertions of the Name
---

Sent the letters. Today is about receiving feedback from S--, and about working on the story. *Morning Regrets* has become *The Path to Self-Consciousness* (it still has both and neither title: the first is just the filename; the second is just a working title, and is too epic to be appropriate for the story's aesthetic mode). I'm still working on integrating those prayerful insertions of the name into the computer; to be ended on the moment of sending her a message. Wow. It should have been on Twitter, the website that I actually use; but it's more funny that I had to use an adapter to pipe my message into another communication protocol. I used Messenger to slide into the DMs of an Instagram account. That's hysterical. You can't make that sort of thing up, so why would anyone ever bother trying to? I will never understand claims to fiction invented wholecloth.
