title: Nothing is an Excuse for Writing
---

Woke up sneezing sick. No energy, no motivation. Felt like I got everything out yesterday: enough of an effort with the writing for class, with the interview, meeting Daniella, etc that I am excused in a break: the interview excuses my break from looking for a job; the writing excuses my break from writing; being sick excuses me from going to the gym.

Nothing is an excuse for writing. If I don't, I will die.

Vera compared me to the Seducer. Not really, but said that she wonders if I am developing a "science" of women. Conducting experiments is very much in the vein of the seducer. What the foolish woman fails to grasp is that I am merely making observations, not conducting experiments. The possibility of *naive love* is over: that's what I lost with Rachelle. Now I'm too jaded.

What am I going to talk to Erin about? It's not worth applying to SSHRC for Western, because it's fully-funded and I only get 3 slots. Those need to be: Concordia Creative Writing; UBC Creative Writing; McGill? Guelph?

What else? Not much, dear diary. I need to get my nutrients in.

- garlic
- parsley
- celery
- thyme
- milk
- coconut water
- green tea
