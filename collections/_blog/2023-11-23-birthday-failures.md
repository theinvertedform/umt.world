The party itself was a failure: many of the people who said they would attend didn't; there were a few new friends, but attendance in general was down from last year's Christmas party. The food was there unexpectedly, the cookies greeted with a more familiar care.

A moment of joy came at the end of the night, but it will only turn out to be another failure. Coming back from the bar after last call, I ran into the upstairs neighbour. Beautiful and cheerful, she felt safe enough to come inside at 4am for a smoke. Told me that her old roommate with the dog named Olive had a crush on me. C-- was like a joyful ray of sunlight in the night. Warm, cheerful, bubbly. I was too wasted to make an impression---could barely slur together a few limp questions to try to learn a bit more about her.

For 24 hours cold and delirious hours, I was riding high on that one encounter as though it were Pegasus. 15 minutes is enough to fuel a lifetime. The next morning, I got a rejection letter from APCON. When I knocked on the door to return a Trojan horse in the form of a pack of rolling papers. The blonde answered, as usual; and as usual was visibly unhappy to be disturbed.
