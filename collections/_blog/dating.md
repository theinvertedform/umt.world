I subscribed to [r/PurplePillDebate](https://reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate) a few weeks ago, and initially found it quite an amusing and interesting corner of the internet. The concept is simply that people on both ends of the spectrum come together to present arguments representing the "red pill" or "blue pill" view, specifically in regards to sex, dating, and romance.

It's not often that I find myself genuinely pleased by people on the internet. One concrete view of mine that changed, merely through confirmation of a suspicion, is that dating apps simply don't work for men. They don't work for women, either, in the sense that they encourage unhealthy behaviours, but at least there is a higher probability of yielding tangible results.
