title: Life is In the World, Not Synapses
---

This stupid piece of writing. It has no point, nor any kind of relevant atmosphere.

- It needs to be more ancient
- It needs a thesis
- Oral versus written, different styles of architecture
- No matter our cosmology, be thankful for creation	???
- Needs more colour-coding

---

Rally, relational pacing.

- Reading the hinge; no comma or hyphen, but a hinge in the writing.

- Neurodiversity falls into pathology
	- Neuropathy
		- Identity versus neurodiversity
- Pathology returns to mind/body dualism
	- Brain/body versus mind
	- Life is in the world, not synapses
