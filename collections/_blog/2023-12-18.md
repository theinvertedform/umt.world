title: The Plan is to Chill
---

Post-party. Weak. The whole affair. Everything is weak. I need to get my application packages together, because I'm about to lose my chance to work on them! Plus, I have no time to shop.

The plan is to chill and rest as much as possible before the work week begins tomorrow. It's going to be difficult. And I will have no chance to go anywhere. No car of my own.

In the New Year, I will return to the applications. This week I will focus on my gifts. Otherwise---what's going to happen with---anything. Over-extending, doing damage to my reputation. Just by trying to exist. Stupid---chill out. It would have been better if---today, I'm just chilling until I have to go meet the person, and then go to the gym. I'm getting one gift. I need to stop by Wills at some point to get beer. I can get some of that for R--. Mom gets a tote bag, and---? N-- can get some socks. D-- can get some---book?
