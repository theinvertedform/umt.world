title: A Pretty Girl Laughs
---

Nothing to look forward to. No meaning. No life. No future. Only memories. Circling the drain. No prospect of happiness. I feel happy when I make a pretty girl laugh. It makes me feel whole again. The best part of my week is Sunday, when I have the chance to make a pretty girl laugh.

I have become hyperfixated. It's now actually destroying me, and it will continue to destroy me until it's over and done with. Until I quit, or until I am released from this mortal coil...Another parasocial relationship sucking my blood, killing me, destroying me, draining my life-force.
