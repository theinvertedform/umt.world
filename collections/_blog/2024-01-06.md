title: The Old Switch Flip

What an insane night. I have got to stop drinking. At some point, I realized that I was drinking too much at the bar---acting like I knew what I was doing. WTF. Like a desperate guy who is willing to do anything to keep it going. I'm spending money like I'm a rich guy or something, but I'm not. I'm not that good at money management. I'm either all-in, or spending like no tomorrow. I'm either in extreme poverty mode, or extreme spending mode---economizing, or giddily spending to make up for lost time.

I should try to run a scam again. The old Switch flip. We can use that to pay for the laptop's new screen.
