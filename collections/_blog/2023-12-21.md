title: Certain Themes Re-appear
---

I can sense that I'm approaching the limit of what I can accomplish with the story without a long lay-off and/or some help from outside of me. Obviously more could be done to make it more cohesive overall; certain themes that appear in the beginning need to re-appear. More could be done to make the topic of sense-certainty relevant to the rest of the story. Religion, God versus woman, love and loneliness, waking up in the morning---how it feels to be so objectless. Without meaning! Blah blah....

Aside from that, we need to just fix up the letters, remove the excess semi-colons (as S-- suggested), etc. Then we need to prepare the CV and the documents for Western.
