title: What Does Sense-Certainty have to do With Anything?
---

The story is about a guy who says the name of a girl he likes into his phone 3 times; and on the third occasion, her name appears.

Maybe the diversions into Elliot's character are what gives you the space to get into the present. Paralepsis: find a point of commonality that is more meaningful than having the same bag, and bring that back to the present, make it into something real. Something about how different the two of you are.

What does sense-certainty have to do with anything? It's vaguely related to this idea of unconscious recognition, of the crush, desire. Because the idea is that you are thinking about it before you even are aware that you're thinking about it.

The story falls apart. This dialogue on sense-certainty needs to move back and forth through time; we are listening, remembering the conversation; and at the same time we are at Reservoir, looking at the tattoo on a girl's chest, thinking about where the rest of the pattern must fall---on the *tits*. She notices you noticing her and gives a breezy smile on her way out.
