title: Chasing Numbers
---
Apply at vinvinvin. Send pitches for the Wolfgang review. Read Gravity's Rainbow. Read Hegel. Gym. Figure something out with the money. Apply for a few more jobs. How am I going to find a wife? Where's the progress there? None: instead, I sublimate my desire into more gym-going...I want STRENGTH! I'm chasing numbers. Focus on bringing the weight up, rather than the volume, especially on OHP.
