title: Chasing Numbers
---

Apply at vinvinvin. Send pitches for the Wolfgang review. Read Gravity's Rainbow. Read Hegel. Go to the gym. Figure something out with the money. Apply for a few more jobs. 

When am I going to find a wife? Where's the progress there? None: instead, I sublimate my desire into the gym...if I can't be happy, at least I can be strong! Chase the number. Bring the weight up, not the volume---especially on the overhead press.
