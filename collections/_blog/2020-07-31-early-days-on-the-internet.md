Spent some time falling into a nostalgia trap, and going back through old message board archives and reading my 13-14 year old self talking shit. I was a rude, cynical bastard at that age. I had a lot of anger inside. Not enough attention at home; too much instability. I wrote about some memories using The Place in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/theinvertedform/status/1273462453398110208). The two forums I was reading through were Martial Arts Planet (MAP), and the Crestfallen Studios community board. Maybe someday Iâ€™ll reveal my username. Real ones already know.
