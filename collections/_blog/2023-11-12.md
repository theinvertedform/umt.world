title: Taking a Crack
---

Trying to take a crack at the Western application. By God, it's all impossible, LOL!

UWO and Concordia are now the main ones, because S--'s endorsement makes me think maybe I actually have a chance.

What else. The weekend has been immensely depressing and lonely. The calendar is an undifferentiated stretch of loneliness. For my birthday this year, I will have no-one to go to the spa with, no-one to go to dinner with. The season is already almost over. No-one cares---it doesn't matter---C-- is probably dead---I might as well kill myself, no-one would care. My hope is to just drown it all out---if I can sublimate my own unhappiness into a creative project, be one of those artists who makes one intense, juvenile work that cuts close to the bone, rather than the kind of artist with a diverse body of work; well, I'll take it.
