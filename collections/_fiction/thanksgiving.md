Trees change their colours. Temperature changes, more slowly now but just as inexorably. Climate change won't put off the winter. The sun moves from Virgo, last of the earth signs for the year, into airy Libra---then into watery Scorpio. The leaves change their colours. The earth hardens. Animals scurry about with renewed vigour. The stones brace themselves, locked into their earthen hollows. The river seems to rush more quickly, as though by the overcompensation of its movement it could halt the freeze. The cold descends from the sky, which is why it hits the mountaintops first. A blanket pressed onto the earth, silencing all excess noise and seeming to smother the world. But it is not death that the cold brings, but rather the suspension of life. It is by the grace of hibernation that life leaps from one year to the next. Without the anaesthesia of the freezing snow, the hard earth, the fire in the night would burn only half as bright.

"Tell me a story," the littlest one says one dark night. It's just after dinner time, but almost completely dark out in the world. The world quickens, the pendulum swings, slipping from summer into autumn into winter. When does the season change? Inexorably: one day it is winter. But we haven't even had the first snow yet.

The father wracks his brains while the mother looks on from over the fire. He learned the ancestors' stories in their own language, and passes it on to their children. She is still learning. Wasn't quite so lucky. Targeted, you might say, by the scoop, her shiny black braid making her a target, even as a young girl.

The stories need to be changed. The world is different now. But in changing, do we lose our connection to the world they emerged from? Who is he to alter stories passed on from generations? He expressed this guilt to her once, and she pointed out that the stories, if they had been changed, would never have been preserved to begin with: he is only connected to the previous generation. Father and grandfather dead. It is his job to change the story to suit the times. The story isn't the point: it's the telling. If the storyteller tells the truth, the basic element of the story will shine through.

"A turtle stands on its back, and another turtle stands on its back. On the back of that turtle sits the world. But the turtles are getting tired, and as they grow tired, their bodies heat up. That heat passes into the world."

The story is a malleable thing. It changes each time in the telling. There's something at the core that remains the same: that's what gets passed down. That is the sign of the ancestor. The basic element of the story is this: everything is connected. There is nothing separate. There is no "I," no "you," no "we." There is only the world, moving as the wind blows through it. Everything is movement, everyone is connected, all are a part of the same fabric. The fabric extends in all directions, even laterally, through the human perception of linear time. The past lives in the present. It lives through this story, it lives through our brother tree, our brother otter, bear. These creatures of the world know better than we do: they embody the ceaseless continuity of movement through time. The bear does not think of herself as an I, but rather just a particular embodiment of what it means to be a bear in the world. The bear tears apart the log in search of termites, swings her great paws through the river in search of salmon, gets drunk gorging on fermented blueberries as though each of these is a sacred task.

"Tell me a story," the young boy says. He sits around a fire, too, but this time in a stone house. The Adriatic storms outside. Although the windows are open to the world, the architecture shields them from the rains, so they lie huddled and dry in their skins as the world slips into autumn. Aristophanes takes a long pull from his chalice before he begins.

"There is no beginning and no end, only an eternal circle. A ring of fire marks the passage from one circuit to the next. When we pass through this ring of fire, everything is burned away, and the world is reduced to its minimal state of being. Each particularity is obliterated, but each particularity has the chance to become anew again."

"Tell me a story," the girl says. They are slaves on a ship in the very Adriatic that storms. The white tips of waves almost as tall as the mast lash the deck. Soldier-sailors crawl about like insects, lashing down the sails and making sure that everything is still battened down. The more seaworthy of them stay where they are, taking a chance to get a rest in.

"In the beginning, there was nothing but rain. Rain coming from out of the void, falling into the void. Then there came the swerve: one drop moved in its straight path and came into contact with another. The two joined, fused, became one extra-large droplet. Soon more joined it, attracted by its mass, and then before long, there was an entire world."
