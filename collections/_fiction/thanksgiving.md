Life begins in the East, in the autumn when the world is turning yellow. The sign of life is death. 

We move counter-clockwise to the North, whose winter-blue wind is the most powerful of all spirits. Released by the hubris of man, the North wind has full reign of the year and runs rampant, causing floods, tornadoes, droughts, famine, earthquakes. Frogs fall from the sky; a fox whispers in tongues; morning after morning, the sun fails to rise.

After Winter comes Spring, to the West, where the red sun sets against a world lingering blue. We are inching closer and closer to the Great Conflagration. Everything will be burned down to its smallest parts, and each charged with the velocity of sparks flying from the fire. The South is black as cinder, hot summer nights, the twin suns that rise over lost Carcosa. Green sits in verdant splendour at the centre of things, a wind the colour of life, glowing with the brilliance of radioactive waste.

Was the world born in fire, water, earth, or air? Or did it take shape gradually, revealing itself to the people as they learned to inhabit it? The People of the Longhouse tell a story of a husband and wife who live in the land of the sky, sustained by the many fruits of a splendid tree. The husband was called Otáhe, "Guardian of the Tree," and the wife is called Atsi’tsaká:ion, "Sky Woman." When Sky Woman becomes pregnant, in her cravings she tells her husband to make her a tea from the roots of the tree. He begins to dig a hole; when she comes to check on his progress, she peers down into the hole and falls through the sky into our world. At that time, our world was nothing more than a great ocean populated by all the creatures of the water. A pair of swans catch her and she alights safely on the back of a turtle.

"I can't raise my children here," Sky Woman says. "There's nothing for them to eat. I have seeds, but no earth to plant them in."

Otter volunteers to dive down to the bottom of the ocean and bring her back some soil. Some time later, the poor creature's drowned body floats to the surface.

Beaver dives next, strong flat tail paddling confidently through the water; but even she is barely able to make it back, her long-nailed fingers never having touched the soil on the ocean floor.

Finally, Muskrat dives. After a long moment, exhausted, she struggles to pull herself onto the back of the turtle, a clump of earth clutched in her paw.

Sky Woman plants her seeds, gives birth to twins, and the back of the turtle spreads into mountains, deserts, lakes, plains, and forests. This land is an island on the back of a turtle.

It is impossible for me to say when this story was first told. What we do know is that it was given to the People of the Longhouse by a trickster spirit. The Haudenosaunee who passed this story on for generations had a fundamentally different relationship to time than we moderns; they also have a long and violent history with those of us who write from the vantage of the settler. The work of translating an oral culture into writing can successfully freeze a segment of time, but we remain on the outside of a culture that lives and changes to this day. It is not just a question of translating between languages or between media, but between linear and non-linear experience of time. The time of Spirit that we are all familiar with is straight and arrow-like, each point in its flight marked by an indomitable Word as objective as a carbon-dated obelisk. The time of spirits is a Now whose recollection of the past is filtered through the present, so that each memory is tinted differently according to the season in which we recall it. Ten thousand years is no more or less distant than one moon, and both come alive in the blue light of the present.

Across the ocean from where the turtle swims, other tribes begin to record the passage of time by etching it in stone. Writing allowed this tribe to project itself into a static futurity---writing is *sub specie aeternitatis*, "from the perspective of eternity." Every text a coiled spring storing energy, never exhausted in the reading but always saving a share for the next reader. The steles of ancient Babylon and the hieroglyphs of the Old Kingdom bridge the gap between mythical time and historical time. That bridge is long distant. We can never return to myth; the cold blue light of historical time is inescapable. The North wind howling like a demon around the globe is the same colour as the blue light of the interface that characterizes modern life.

The philosophers of antiquity had their own tradition of telling creation stories, transcribed by their followers in the following way: everything is water, whose tendency to slosh about provides the principle of motion. But how does water give rise to fire? Maybe everything should be air instead, which can fan flames, condense liquids, and propagate life across the surface of the earth. Maybe, instead of an element, the *arche* should be something---indefinite; a characterless substance capable of taking form as the varied fruits that grow from a single trunk.

Maybe we need something a bit more dynamic. A Demiurge takes chaos into his mixing-bowl and, following a recipe, mixes up a perfectly balanced cosmos. He creates the Pantheon first, each of whom becomes responsible for some aspect of the mortal world. Like the spirit of the animals, the stones, the trees, the rivers, lakes, and winds, the middle-layer mediates between the finite and the infinite. This creation story has become paradigmatic because it formalized the tripartite model of the major religions. The Creator will not interact directly with the mortal realm until the birth of Jesus Christ nearly four hundred years later.

Winedark waves reach up the cliff, up towards the window of a stone and timber house. Behind shutters closed against the driving rain is a child who can't sleep. The furious thunder and flashing lightning outside have her sitting up in bed, wide-eyed and trembling under the covers. She asks Epicurus to tell her a story, small hands twisting a woolen blanket dyed red and longing for last Spring, when the storms were fewer and less intense. Logs blaze in the corner, warming the slate floor. The window is deeply set, keeping the fine spray of water that manages to get through the slats out of the room.

"Did I ever tell you about the first storm?" he begins. "When it started, there was just rain falling in the night, with no wind. The drops fell in straight lines. None of them thought to break out of their ranks---until one day, one drop breaks formation. It swerves to the side---just a touch, but enough to bump into its neighbour. The two become one, bigger than any of the others. It keeps falling through the night, every now and then swerving this way or that. The raindrop grows so big that it can hold its own storms, seas, cliffs; there's even a sun, moon, and stars contained in this single raindrop. At first it was just one drop among as many as there are in the storm outside, but it became as big as the cosmos just by moving a tiny fraction. And there are other drops, as big as this one, with other little girls just like you; and they are asking their fathers to tell them a story...."

The basic tripartite division of divine labour, from Creator to the lesser gods (or spirits), to the mortal realm, is common around the world. There needs to be something between the finite and the infinite. The great innovation of Christianity is to introduce the concept of *faith* in the proposition that an infinite God came into finite existence in the form of the son. A proposition simultaneously literal, and impossible to reconcile with reason. Such a proposition would have deeply aggravated the philosophers of antiquity as an addition that over-complicates their brutal simplicity.

The fortified village of Hochelaga had already been established near *Mont-Royal* for centuries before Cartier came down the river. Its precise location is not known to us, but a marker on the grounds of McGill University designates one potential site. It was built either on the South bank of Mont-Royal; or to the North, on the "other" side; or possibly even at the summit of the ancient hill. In the thousands of years people have inhabited the area, there must have been villages all over the place, their remains forever buried under layers of concrete and sub-basements.

One of those who stood curiously on the bank of the river and greeted the white men who disembarked from their strange boat was called Running Mountain. He lived in Hochelaga with three generations of his descent; they spoke Algonquin first, as many other families in the village did. Running Mountain came from down South. 

"You must take news of these white men back home. You have never been there, but the place I and my father were born is also the place of your birth, even if you came out of your mother here. Make a pilgrimage to the holy site I used to visit as a child; and at the same time, share what you have seen here today with all those you come across." 

The son of Running Mountain, together with his son and daughter---both grown and with babies of their own---travel for a quarter-moon, by canoe and by foot to reach the place. They set off as the forest is yellowing.

Here, the three of them found a site over a thousand years old by the time they came to it; two thousand years old by the time modern archaeology comes to it. Grass grows on tiered mounds of earth packed three stories high; water flows in channels cut through the turf, helped upwards through the aid of screws. The earth used to construct the earthworks is taken from the excavation of moats and several smaller mounds and caches arranged asymmetrically around the primary site. The whole complex is built into the terrain from materials taken from the area. A form of architectural cultivation, open to the world and absent sense of the abstraction that comes from traditional material cultures.

The Doric capital sits on top of the column, a mathematically-derived solution to the problem of supporting a roof with a colonnade. The roof is a hat on the world; even as an enclosed structure, it remains open to the world, a membrane that marks the earliest form of cultural alienation from creation. The Greek naive smile is said to represent the "children of the West's" supposed naivete. It's nothing more than plausible deniability.

The earth hardens. Animals rustle through the leaves, scurrying with renewed urgency to build up their undercoats and blubber. The stones brace themselves, hunkering deep in their earthen hollows. The river's spray seems to illustrate the horizon of possibility, as though with exaggerated rapidity it could delay the coming freeze. Cold descends from the sky, hitting the mountaintops first. A blanket falls, silencing all in an early night. It is not death that the cold brings, but rather the slumber of gathering strength. By the grace of hibernation, life moves from one year to the next. Without the anaesthesia of the freezing snow, the hard earth, the fire in the night would burn only half as bright.

The stories have changed. The world is tuned to a different key. The translation of ancient songs into a modern rhythm does not create their loss, but preserves them in the flight of an arrow. Fire does not change depending on the fuel we burn. Father and grandfather have both returned to the earth. Son and daughter pass on the stories to their children, each in their own ways. The story is less important than the telling, which, in repetition, cannot conceal the truth.

"A woman falls from the world of the sky...."

There is only the wind of the world blowing. The same cosmic momentum is carried through this story, as it is through the tree, the quills of the porcupine, the fur of a prairie dog. Bear tears apart a log in search of termites, swipes her great paw through the river in search of salmon; she gorges on fermented blueberries and sleeps through the night.

The Great Conflagration is the moment when the wheel of time begins over again; a heat capable of burning everything down to its smallest part could only be a blue flame. The world is becoming more and more blue as we get closer and closer to the end of the cycle. Before winter wipes the slate clean, we have a moment to say what we are thankful for. I am thankful for my ancestors, whose names I honour: my grand-papa Norman and grand-maman Georgette; my grandfather Peter and my grandmother Isabelle. Along with my father, all have returned to the earth. I do what I can to honour my mother, my aunts and uncles, my cousins, nieces and nephews---but my eyes have difficulty making out details in the shadow cast in blue light. I am thankful for those who took care of this land before me: I walk by rivers and mountains that were home to people who lived here long before mine stole it from them. I live in the rooms of an apartment that others have lived in before; I owe my home to them. I am thankful to all my teachers, who, one way or another, gave me an example of critique. I am thankful for all the friends and lovers who have nourished me: it is by your grace that life gains its deepest meaning. I am thankful to all who have shared their creation stories.
