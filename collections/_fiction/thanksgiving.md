Life begins in the East, in the autumn when the world has already begun to turn yellow. The sign of life is death. 

We move counter-clockwise to the North, whose glacial wind is the most powerful spirit of them all. Released by the hubris of man, the North wind has full reign of the year, running rampant and causing floods, tornadoes, droughts, famine, earthquakes. Frogs fall from the sky---a fox whispers in tongues---morning after morning, the sun fails to rise.

After Winter comes Spring over in the West, where the red sun sets against a world lingering blue. Each rotation of the wheel is another degree closer to the Great Conflagration. A fire that burns everything down to its smallest part, charging each atom with the velocity of a spark flying from the fire. The South is black as cinder, hot summer nights, the twin suns that rise over the Great Lake Hali. Green sits in verdant splendour at the centre of things, a wind the colour of life, glowing with the eerie brilliance of radioactive waste.

Was the world born in fire, water, earth, or air? Or did it take shape gradually, revealing itself as the people learned to inhabit it? The People of the Longhouse tell a story of a husband and wife who live in the land of the sky, sustained by the many fruits of an enormous tree. The husband is called Otáhe, "Guardian of the Tree," and the wife is called Atsi’tsaká:ion, "Sky Woman." When Sky Woman becomes pregnant, in her cravings she tells Guardian of the Tree to make her a tea from its roots. He begins to dig; she comes to check on his progress, peers down into the hole and falls through the sky into our world---at that time, nothing more than a great ocean populated by all the creatures of the water. A pair of swans catch her and she alights safely on the back of a turtle.

"I can't raise my children here," Sky Woman says. "There's nothing to eat. I have seeds here in my pockets, but there's no earth to plant them in."

Otter volunteers to dive down to the bottom of the ocean and bring her back some soil. Some time later, the poor creature's drowned body floats to the surface.

Beaver dives next, strong flat tail paddling confidently through the water; but even she is barely able to make it back, her long-nailed fingers never having touched the ocean floor.

Finally, Muskrat dives. After a long while, exhausted, she struggles to pull herself onto the back of the turtle with a clump of earth clutched in her paw.

Sky Woman plants her seeds, gives birth to twins, and the back of the turtle spreads into mountains, deserts, lakes, plains, and forests.

It's impossible to say when this story was first told, but we do know that it was given to the Haudenosaunee by a trickster spirit. The People of the Longhouse carried it with them out of a different reality than the one we moderns live in. A reality, a time, and a form of consciousness that appear as an impenetrable fog to those outside of it. A reality that has been violently subjugated by those rooted to the transparency of settler consciousness. The path between realities is not so clear-cut as writing down a story that hitherto no-one thought to. Such practises petrify a moment of time, but we remain on the outside of a culture that lives and breathes to this day. It is not just a question of translating between languages or between media, but between linear and non-linear experience of time. Between the mythic consciousness of a cloud, and the rooted consciousness of a tree. The reality of Spirit that we moderns experience is straight and arrow-like, each point in its flight marked by an indomitable Word as objective as a carbon-dated obelisk. The time of spirits is a Now whose recollection of the past is filtered through the present, so that each memory is tinted differently according to the light of the moment in which we recall it. Ten thousand years is no more or less distant than a moon's cycle, and both are born into the blue light of the present.

Across the water from where the turtle swims, other tribes begin to record the passage of time by etching each day into stone. Writing allows them to project themselves into a static futurity. It is a medium *sub specie aeternitatis*, "from the perspective of eternity." Every text is a coiled spring vibrating with potential energy, never exhausted in the reading, always saving an equal share for the next one. The steles of ancient Babylon and the hieroglyphs of the Old Kingdom bridge the gap between mythical time and historical time. We have long since crossed that bridge. We will never return to myth without also descending into barbarism, a poor price to pay. The glacial light of historical time saturates past, present, and future. The Northern wind that howls like a demon around the globe is the same colour as the interface that characterizes modernity.

The philosophers of antiquity had their own tradition of telling creation stories, transcribed by their followers as follows: everything is water, whose tendency to slosh around provides the principle of motion. But how does water give rise to fire? Maybe everything should be air instead, which can fan flames, condense into liquid, and propagate life across the surface of the earth. Maybe, instead of an element, the *arche* should be something---indefinite, a characterless substance capable of taking form as the varied fruits that grow from a single trunk.

Maybe we need something a bit more dynamic. A Demiurge takes chaos into his mixing-bowl and, following a recipe, mixes up a perfectly balanced cosmos. He creates the Pantheon first, each of whom becomes responsible for some aspect of the mortal world. Like the spirit of the animals, the stones, the trees, the rivers, lakes, the four winds---this middle layer mediates between the finite and the infinite. This particular story remains paradigmatic for having formalized the tripartite model common to the major religions. The Creator will not interact directly with the mortal realm until the birth of Jesus Christ nearly four hundred years later.

Winedark waves reach up the cliff, up towards the window of a stone and timber house. Behind shutters closed against the driving rain lies a child who can't sleep. The boom of thunder and the flash of lightning have her sitting up in bed, wide-eyed and trembling under the covers. She asks her father to tell her a story, small hands twisting a woolen blanket dyed red. She longs for last Spring, when the storms were fewer and less intense. Logs blaze in the corner, warming the stone floor. The window is set deep enough to keep away the fine spray of droplets that find their way through the wooden slats.

"Did I ever tell you about the first storm?" he begins. "When it started, there was just rain falling in the night, with no wind. The drops fall in straight lines. None of them thought to break rank---until one day, one drop moves out of formation. It swerves to the side---just a touch, but enough to bump into its neighbour. The two become one, bigger than any of the others. This drop keeps falling through the night, every now and then swerving this way or that. It grows so big that it can hold its own storms, seas, cliffs, houses; there's even a sun, moon, and stars contained in this single raindrop. At first it was just one drop among as many as there are in the storm outside, but it became as big as the cosmos just by moving an inch. And there are other drops, as big as this one, with other little girls just like you; and they sit up, asking father to tell them a story...."

The basic tripartite division of divine labour, from Creator, to the lesser gods (or spirits), to the mortal realm, is common around the world. There needs to be something between the finite and the infinite. The great innovation of Christianity is to introduce the concept of *faith* in the proposition that an infinite God came into finite existence in the form of the son. A proposition simultaneously literal, and impossible to reconcile with reason. Such a proposition would have deeply aggravated the philosophers of antiquity as a hideous addition that over-complicates their brutal simplicity.

The fortified village of Hochelaga had been established near *Mont-Royal* long before Cartier came down the river. Its precise location is not known to us, but a marker on the grounds of McGill University designates one potential site. It was built either on the South bank of Mont-Royal; or to the North, on the "other" side; or possibly even at the summit of the ancient hill. In the thousands of years people have inhabited the area, there could only have been villages all over the place whose remains are now forever buried under layers of concrete and sub-basements.

One of those who stood curiously on the bank of the river and greeted the white men who disembarked from their strange boat was called Running Mountain. He lived in Hochelaga with three generations of his descent; they spoke Algonquin first, as many other families in the village did. Running Mountain came from a village to the South. 

"You must take news of these white men back home. You have never been there, but the place I and my father were born is also the place of your birth, even if you came out of your mother here. Make a pilgrimage to the holy site I used to visit as a child; and at the same time, share what you have seen here today with all those you come across." 

The son of Running Mountain, together with his son and daughter---both grown and with babies of their own---set off as the forest is turning yellow, the air cold. They travel for a quarter-moon, by canoe and by foot to reach the place.

Here, the three of them found a site over a thousand years old by the time they came to it; two thousand years old by the time modern archaeologists scan it with their instruments. Grass grows on tiered mounds of earth packed three stories high; water flows in channels cut through the turf, forced upwards with the aid of carved wooden screws. The earth used to construct the earthworks is taken from the excavation of moats and several smaller mounds and caches arranged asymmetrically around the primary site. The whole complex is built into the terrain from materials taken from the area. A form of architectural cultivation, open to the world and absent the sense of abstraction that comes from traditional material cultures.

The Doric capital sits on top of the column, a mathematically-derived solution to the problem of how to support a roof using a colonnade while maintaining a symmetrical arrangement. Like the open walls of the temple, the capital is a naked solution in favour of brutalist harmony. The roof is a hat on the world; even as an enclosed structure, it remains open, a membrane that marks the earliest form of cultural alienation from creation. The Greek naive smile is said to represent the "children of the West's" supposed naivete. Its function is to allow for plausible deniability.

The earth hardens. Animals rustle through fallen leaves, scurrying with renewed urgency to build up their furry undercoats and layers of blubber. The stones brace themselves, hunkering deeper in earthen hollows. The river's spray illustrates the horizon of possibility, as though with exaggerated rapidity it could delay the coming freeze. Cold descends from the sky, hitting the mountaintops first. A blanket falls, silencing all in an early night. The cold brings sleep, merely the cousin of death; a slumber of gathering strength. By the grace of hibernation, life moves from one year to the next. Without the anaesthesia of the numbing snow, the fire in the night would only burn half as bright.

The stories have changed. The world is tuned to a different key. The translation of ancient songs into a modern dialect does not create their loss, but preserves them in the flight of an arrow. Fire does not change depending on the fuel we burn. Father and grandfather have both returned to the earth. Son and daughter pass on the stories to their children, each in their own ways. The story is less important than the telling, which, in repetition, cannot conceal the truth.

"A woman falls from the world of the sky...."

There is only the wind of the world blowing. The same cosmic momentum is carried through this story, as it is through the trees, the quills of the porcupine, the fur of a prairie dog. A bear tears apart a log in search of termites, swipes her great paw through the river in search of salmon; she gorges on fermented blueberries and sleeps through the night.

The Great Conflagration is the moment when the wheel of time begins over again. The celestial fire that burns everything down to its smallest part could only be a blue flame. The world is becoming more and more blue as we get closer and closer to the end of the cycle. Before winter wipes the slate clean, we have a moment to say what we are thankful for. I am thankful for my ancestors, whose names I honour: my grand-papa Norman and grand-maman Georgette; my grandfather Petar and my grandmother Isabelle. Along with my father Peter, all of them have returned to the earth. I do what I can to honour my mother, my brothers and sister, my aunts and uncles, my cousins, nieces and nephews---but my eyes lose detail in the shadows cast by blue light. I am thankful for those who took care of this land before me: I walk by rivers and mountains that were home to people who lived here long before my ancestors stole it from them. I live in the rooms of an apartment marked by the others who have lived here before me; I have a home thanks to a lease that circulated through the community, eventually finding its way to me. I am thankful to all my teachers, who, one way or another, gave me an example of critique. I am thankful for all the friends and lovers who have nourished me: it is by your grace that life gains its truest meaning. I am thankful to my past self for practising what he did that brought me here, and to all who have shared their creation stories.
