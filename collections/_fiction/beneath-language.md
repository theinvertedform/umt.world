Basic concept: follow a body through various phases. Narrative of a body in different atmospheric environments. Connection between past and present.

1. Begin from a disembodied perspective. Contrast adjacent forms of the body, specifically the economic. Narrow in on the individual in the world. A form of disembodiment that comes from economic alienation. Atmosphere of regret and disconnect between one's history and present.

2. Another atmosphere of disembodiment, this time coming from social alienation. In the context of a classroom, where the man is taken out of his body. 

3. Third atmosphere of disembodiment, this time sexual. Sex is as powerful a mode of embodiment as any other.

# Description, adjacent

Sometimes I am so drawn into the pleasure of my sensing-body that I lapse into idyll, and therefore need to be reminded of my facticity. The scorching ray of an all-seeing eye falls on me, and I am brought crashing back down into my paper-body. Who I have been---and by some vague extension, not lacking in a Protestant ethic, who I am privileged to be now.

We might feel differently about the organism our *cogito* is attached to, but no-one likes to be interpellated. In the course of a life, each of us will sew an idol representing ourselves; and if we fail to repay our debts, it is the duty of our creditor to stick pins through the stuffing of our joints and send bolts of pain screaming out of the blue light of an interface, glimpsed in the half-light of a bored moment at the bar. Sometimes I lapse into idyll, and therefore need to be reminded of my own facticity. A facade of sociality that slips beneath the waves of forgetting, laying bare an iron edifice of fiduciary obligation. There's no more rude awakening than a reminder of our economic trail. I tried to set fire to my icon as though it were a Wicker Man, but the rain put it out. My debts haunt me like a spectre that phases into the corporeal when I need to be disciplined, before disappearing back into the alien unknown. A creature of the imagination hovering on the edge of my peripheral, tinting my vision black when the pain overcomes me out of nowhere. *Don't make me do it. I don't like it any more than you do.* The trace of the way we lived in the world; who we are, best understood as *who we are no longer*. A tether to the past, an unjust fetter, but---let's be honest: have we really changed? Aren't we still the same desperate phylum scrabbling for survival, borrowing money without a plan for how to pay it back, from someone whose memory triggers a split dioptre? 

Remember? She's still there, out of sight but adjacent, still in the same world as you.

*hello*

# Description, alongside

Alongsideness is personal. It comes with solidarity. What kind of body does it make to be alongside others? Rarely, it takes me outside of my body; more often, it traps me inside. A caged animal looking out through the windows of the soul. Self-conscious, consciousness-of-self. But so much in my body! Invisible, but at the same time there's a spotlight on me. I am lit up, tense.

Alongside these others, I feel out of my body. When I'm at work, I am only alongside my co-workers. We move our bodies in a precise choreography around each other. Little eye contact, just taking care of each other. Reading the client's body language. The body is all that matters. It's all I say. The language is already opaque to begin with. 

The threats here are real. People take their bodies seriously. People take my body seriously. I have seen men change their posture and adopt an attitude when I join their presence. Defensive. They should realize that I have no interest in them: I am only here to do my job. My job is to keep their body moving through the ride that is the experience of going out to eat and drink. Keep it moving.

I am not alongside the clients, only my co-workers. Our bodies against theirs. They come from the street, the service staff emerge from behind the counter, and we meet in the dining room. There is always a membrane between us. It suffuses the institution; we are immersed in its embryonic fluid, even when the service staff is not separated from the client by a literal bar. The parasocial membrane is flexible, such that the entire place becomes suffused in nightmare.

# Dialogue (that grows the personality of the encounter, not the individual)

"Do you consent?"

*yes/no*

"Does this feel good?" she asked.

"Feels great," he said, looking down at her with utmost confidence.

"I want you to lick it up and down. I want you to take it in your hand and move it up and down, slowly. I want you to make yourself wet, soaking wet. I want to feel you dripping pussy juice all over me."

"I want you 

"I like it when you touch me like that, but use two fingers. Lick them first. Let me see them shine."

"You keep your hand there. Just hold it, squeeze it, let me know you're thinking about it."

"Take me, I want it now. All of you."

"I'm going to hurt you. Tell me your safe word."

"The first day you fucked me. Now turn me over."

"Give me your panties. I'm going to put them in your mouth. I don't want to hear a word from you. Tell me your safe word, let me make sure I can hear it."

*mumbles*

"I'll put it in your ass. Put the pillow under your hips, I want it up in the air."

Sweat-streaked forehead pressed into the pillow.

This is not eroticism, but pornography.

"Hey," she said with a smile upon entering the hall. He was sitting there waiting for class to begin.
