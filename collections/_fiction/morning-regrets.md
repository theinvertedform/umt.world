# Sheer Being

Children cry upon waking, dragged unwilling from the deathlike womb of sleep to face the world again. Adults with uneven temperaments wake up hostile and angry. Relationships fall apart in the morning, when grumpiness reveals a dissatisfaction that betrays the basic premise of love. Love should be power enough to orient one's spirit, light enough to illuminate the pale triviality of everything that clutters the day. Work is put in its proper place, which is second tier. When the lover wakes up unhappy, such a mood reveals that he has turned his back to the source of life, and regressed to idol worship. Money, health, ambition: love gives us respite from the harsh necessity of these instruments to cleave a place to live into the world. What love offers instead is a life of pure, leisurely enjoyment---an escape from economic reality.

The devout recall a prayer to mind immediately upon waking, a habit engrained through constant repetition. A prayer to soothe the anxious passage back to life from deathlike slumber. A lifetime of practice trains the body to receive the gift of life with an appropriate mix of fear and gratitude for the love of its creator's blessing. Devotion fortifies the vulnerable seams of consciousness with fear of the almighty. Morning prayer grounds the individual spirit in praise before we have a chance to settle into whatever fallen form the chaotic world has forced us into. God is an immortal light, an infinite power that we fallen might vainly try to imitate. In mortal love, after everything has become instrumental, rust sets in and your instruments decay. Life withers when she leaves you. A mortal girl, ultimately ungoverned by the determinate laws that rule nature, but rather subject to an inscrutable, opaque will that sometimes, you know all too well, operates against her best interests---just like you.

For a hair's breadth before the layers of consciousness fall into place, there is a moment of sheer and immediate being. The sun's rays strike the capillaries of your eyelids, and your waking vision is a kaleidoscope of bloody flowers blooming.

The sun's light powers organic life, and its gravity determines the movement of all bodies in its orbit---whether they know it or not. It is only you who forget what powers life; it is you who abandoned the morning prayer, and replaced the infinite with false idols.

You wake under a cloud of shame. In place of a grounding prayer, your body's habit of pure negativity determines your first thought: *what terrible thing did I do last night*? It must have been very bad to account for the crushing sensation waiting to greet you. Restless sleep was not enough to dispel the disappointment hanging over your bed. Consciousness reborn into smoggy air. The smoke from nearby forest fires turns the sky orange and the air grey. Frustrated desire clings heavy to your chest, a power that wants to reach outward, but unable to do so recoils inwards with the force of absolute negativity.

Shame berates you into facing the day, drives you out of bed after a struggle, down the hall and into the kitchen where you press the button on the electric kettle. Shame can be productive, a sign that you went beyond yourself---even if the effort was not well-received, still a sign of your desire bearing outward witness. A contrast from the constant sense of invisibility. Your body is poorly recovered, weak and aching, malnourished and under-slept, but your head is clear of the effects of alcohol. It takes a considerable amount of libations to bring your will to the point where it can generate force in the world. You did not go to bed until six o'clock on Saturday morning, and then only a few hours before work. It's Sunday now, and although you wake up in a state of high stress, you are physically recovered from the weekend's drinking. A relatively easy night of only six or seven beers, and a small dose of psychedelic tea: not nearly enough of an exoskeleton to substitute for your spinelessness. You give the cat a pet down his back, but are unable to rise from bed immediately. It's difficult when your life is objectless. You are a rogue planet drifting through space. Bodies sail past in parallel orbits, but your gravitational field does not extend beyond the crust of your surface. The only obligation you have is to the cat, and he's just fine. It's easier to cling to unconsciousness, or search your phone for sensation, than to immediately face the day.

You open a cupboard and pull out a digital scale, a bag of whole coffee beans, a paper filter and the plastic cone it sits in, and a hand-crank grinder. You take a short glass whose shape recalls the laboratory beakers you saw in cartoons, measure 18 grams of the light brown beans. The smell that collects inside their paper bag is like warm-roasted, sulfurous loam. You turn the crank on the grinder until the last one has been crushed into an even powder. You dampen the filter in its conical plastic holder, position it over the black and gold mug on top of the scale, level the grounds, and tare the weight. The kettle has a thin, goose-neck spout, so you can evenly wet the coffee with precisely 50 grams of water. As you count down thirty seconds, bubbles form and disappear on the surface of the ground coffee, which turns from light to dark brown. The gas has dissipated, and you pour the rest of the water, leaving just enough space to top with milk and turn the watery black a creamy tan.

Here on earth, concrete can block out the sun. Downtown skylines are like the ancient ziggurats that rose impossibly out of the forest floor, and at whose apex the Emperor becomes one with the sun for those who crane their necks to behold his occult rituals. Performed at midday, it will appear as though the Sun itself let loose the rivers of blood that flow from on high. Idolatry, but more closely aligned to the symbolic heart of the Sun. The ziggurat and the skyscraper are both vain and idolatrous substitutes for the infinite power of the Sun; gravity wells that structure organic life into patterned traffic flows. 

Public institutions bring us into proximity with each other in our public guise, a para-self brought into being by the structure of social relations. In our private capacity, we have the opportunity to be our selves absent the layers of social mediation. The private self is the dark side of our celestial body; the side unilluminated to those who pass by on parallel ecliptics. However, when two bodies sink into orbit, they revolve around each other like the hermaphroditic twin body from Plato's *Symposium*, the original human that cartwheeled across the lands. Your internal cosmos is structured around a constellation of crushes. The beautiful women you have come into contact with---in whom you thought you recognized something---and for whom you will nurse a version of yourself that will remain private until your dying day. Unrealized possibility---Schrodinger's love affair. One for the girl at the coffee shop you go to more often than you can afford. You were the waiter at her staff party last year, flirted with her as you poured her glass after glass of pink wine; but when you saw her again in the autumn, you were too confused by the half-amputated limb of a dying mortal love to mention anything, and now the chance has passed. But you still like to see her smile, like to think: *she must recognize me from somewhere*, and to remember fondly that time when, only half a year ago, you were unquestionably a member of the human species.

You notice the women around you instantly, but it might take weeks before you remember that you are not invisible: the screen is looking back at you. Women are not blank screens for you to project your consciousness onto. They are, in fact, real people whose reality exists outside of your mind.

# The path to self-consciousness

PHIL 486: *Hegel* is from 18h--20h15 in the basement of the FG building on Ste-Catherines. A lesser mall on the downtown strip, partly converted into classrooms. The upper levels, still given to commercial enterprises, have been redone to resemble a glossy food court. Most of the people sitting at the benches there are students, but the wraith-like figures of the downtown homeless drift among them. Descending into the basement is like descending into hell. The escalator is broken, the two flights of stairs trafficked by parallel streams of spirits resurrected from damnation. The wall at the bottom of the stairs is entirely mirrored, an architectural feature designed to increase visibility in the excessively dim lighting. A dance group of four or five girls practises here when class lets out, unfamiliar pop music echoing distorted from a cellphone's tinny speakers. The mingled smell of rotting garbage and sewage hits you as you turn the corner into the main basement passageway. They keep the refuse from the restaurants up above down here. Down the segmented corridor that stretches an entire city block, the interior opens into a strangely cavernous atrium that was once a movie theatre. High ceilings, shadows cast by dim light, and the stink of trash join together to create a malicious gathering hall. There are large puddles of standing water. Trash bins overflow with empty cans of Monster and Red Bull, Styrofoam fast food containers. A draft of sewage blows from the toilets; you notice, week after week, the same stall is always silently occupied, the same pair of shoes visible under the door.

The room is wide and narrow. A far-off din of amplified voices can be discerned through the white walls. The seating creaks unbearably when anyone shifts in their seat. Professor Angelova tumbles into her lectures unpredictably, breathlessly moving pell-mell from opening remarks into lecture. She makes extensive use of the blackboard. Arrows drawn in chalk connect one keyword or paragraph number to another. 

PHIL 486 is cross-listed between the undergraduate and the Philosophy Department's two-year Masters program, and is populated by undergraduate students in the late stages of their degrees, as well as a number of students in the department's two-year Masters program. Led by Professor Angelova, the syllabus consists of the *Phenomenology of Spirit* divided over thirteen weeks. Certain sections are omitted, including, very questionably, "Force and the Understanding." The third of the opening chapters, it is an absolutely essential turning point in Hegel's theory of consciousness. Indeed, it is the stage of the dialectic at which consciousness emerges. It is where the metaphysics of Hegelian ontology are expounded; a section that Deleuze would pick up on in his theory of force in *Nietzsche and Philosophy*.

It took a few rotations before you began to notice Jules. You sit behind her in class and can't avoid seeing the screen of her ThinkPad. The same model as yours, except that yours is old and doesn't leave your desk. A computer-lover's computer. When she pulls up her browser for the first time, her New Tab page gives you something to think about. Loud green text reminds you both to "close this page and go back to what you were doing :)." It's winter outside, freezing cold and snowy. A feeble sun clouded by snow flurries rises late and sets early. You are adrift in darkness; perhaps the Sun has left you like she did, never to return. Apocalyptic cold causes you to shiver and hug yourself. Most of Tuesday is spent inside sunless plastic rooms lit by fluorescent bulbs. It is the habit of your embittered heart to snap up any chance to hold yourself at a distance from others---but this time you stay neutral. The screen doesn't flash up often enough to be a nuisance, because she's focused on her notes. Before your consciousness became aware of her, your corporeal self had already seen itself reflected back at you during that brief moment on the precipice of sheer being. Already your body is beginning to shift its gravitational stabilizers to orient itself in her direction.

Most of what you see of her is the woodland-patterned hoodie she wears almost every week, hood up to hide in. You've seen enough of her face to know that there is no pretension in wearing the hood indoors, and you don't count this additional consideration against her. With each of these decisions to not sink lower into the foam of cynicism, but rather to maintain a balance of favourable disposition, you are walking further down a path of sympathetic alignment. With each weekly rotation, when her path through the world brings her back into proximity, a desire begins to awaken to know about the mysterious paths she takes through the rest of her week.

The class society is dominated by one particular clique that you see from behind. Young and consistently styled, often arriving late or just in time, the seven of them talk among themselves loudly, swearing and discussing their personal lives, a spectacle for all of us outsiders to behold. These ones do not get the same benefit of the doubt as Jules does. As in youth, their performance is the product of overbearing candour; or, as Kant would say, an immaturity that does not heed the distinction between public and private selves. When everything feels as vital and important as it does in one's early 20s, propriety appears as an impossible gulf. There is simply no distinction between private and public selves, because youth do not have a fully-formed self, much less a bifurcated one. 

Daisy is on the inside, but she's 27 and grew up with money. She's old enough and well-trained enough to keep her life compartmentalized when she chooses to. She chats with you a few times during the break, but always when the others have left you. The cushion of your negativity cushions you from the hurtful sense of exclusion. You look just like these people; you have the same interests: that's why you're auditing the Hegel course. You show up more regularly than many of the students who are paying, but your status as a non-enrolled student is an aid to your sense of exclusion and outsiderness. But they don't know anything about you, because you never speak---you don't post your poems on the class message-board---you don't give a presentation. Instead, as the weeks wear on, you retreat further and further below the surface, so that the few times you did manage to interject into the class discussions becomes more and more of a distant memory. The cynicism is there to protect you by separating yourself. Most of all, it gives you distance from yourself, for it is you and you alone who are to blame for her not knowing your name. Because you look down on them, you are able to not feel bad for not being part of the cool group. The boys are all contemptible, more transparently arrogant and proud than you ever were at that age---except for one well-dressed, handsome young man with a shaved head. His name is Elliot. He pulls a small, new-looking Apple laptop from his bag, but writes in a thick, full-sized notebook. His pen case is a slim pouch of aged brown leather.

In the first weeks of the class, when group dynamics have not solidified with you on the outside, you speak. The topic is sense-certainty, the movement from immediate being to the next moment. In the moment of apprehending the This, consciousness in its barest theoretical form passes from "immature" immediacy to "mature" immediacy. These are the terms Elliot uses to refer to the two stages present in this section. His voice is calm and collected, well-projected but not too loud, clearly articulating what he understands without trying to overextend his reach into the unknown.

"This movement to 'mature' sense-certainty seems to be a linguistic operation."

"I like these terms mature and immature, because it's true that there is a movement in the section. For the moment of sheer being that sense-certainty refers to, we experience being as such, without mediation. However, for consciousness to refer to such a moment implies an act of duration. The fact is that time, duration in the act of pointing, is what leads to the development from immature to mature sense-certainty. It's not so much a question of linguistics."

Jules speaks, pivoting in her swivel chair so that she is parallel to the front of the class and can make eye contact with you.

"I think it's important what you said about sense-certainty, because I think it gives us a way to critique the idea that the way sense-certainty falls away, is any kind of absolute thing---anything spiritual, that could take the place of God."

The immediate knowledge of sense-certainty is as reassuring as a dream; and it falls away in the manner of a dream as the layers of consciousness settle into place,

One day, maybe a month into class, Daisy speaks to you during the break. You scurried through the hall of the damned, like a rat along the edge of the lake of hell. She accosts you where the hall narrows.

"Hey! Do you think we will get the reading group back up?"

"Maybe---I'm not sure." She's asking you because you were the host, and it's the result of your neglect that the group dissolved. However, from your perspective, it is just as much the result of their having abandoned you. No-one bothered to follow up when you stopped sending the invites. There was no mutuality in the relation: it was entirely one-sided.

"Do you miss it?"

You hesitate for a moment, looking down at her. You want to reach across the gulf and let her know that you blame her just as much as she blames you. You want her to know that she has hurt you, but because she has pushed you out of her private life---you can only show her your public face. You give her the truth, unable to do otherwise, but offer nothing more.

"Yes. Do you?"

"Yeah, I do."

# Atmosphere

You have little impression of her body until one Tuesday evening. Weeks have passed, but it's just as dark and cold as ever when you notice something different. This is the precise moment when your awareness of her moves from subterranean to above-ground. You notice that she's had her nails done. Clear and purple-tipped. That's your colour. The New Tab page was girlish, but this is feminine. You finally notice that she is a woman.

You forgot about Jules, somewhat. Assumed you would never see her again once school was out. Until seeing her the other night. Seeing her again makes you remember sitting behind her in Hegel class for months on end. It is simultaneously a callback to an infernal period of your life, when you were a damned soul---but also a callback to when your life had meaning, briefly: hope in the potential of a crush. An object that you could orient yourself around. Noticing her nails one day; noticing the way she played with her hair another. These concrete elements that stick out in my memory don't matter. What does matter is the *recognition of recognition*.

When we talk about "atmosphere," how do we discern between our projections and a trans-subjective phenomena? When I write that the atmosphere in this class was infernal, a weekly reminder of my own disappointment in myself, a weekly moment of hate, how can I possibly assert that this was truly the atmosphere of the room? Of course, everything is a matter of projection. When we try to describe the unconscious affective tone of a room, something suspended between social agents, something in the air, we are not in the realm of quantifiable properties. There is no theoretical principle that we can hang an assertion on, other than the fact that every room has some atmosphere. We are discussing qualities of the room. How can I say that the atmosphere in this room is oppressive? Sometimes it's obvious; other times, less so. In this case, I can see that this room was constituted by a co-mingling of atmospheres. Mine is not the only one; the cool kids clique brought their own powerful charge with them. It overrode everything else, such that it was clear that the boys at its centre were not attuned to anyone outside their circle. But she was on the edge of that circle. Did she ever notice my depression, or the attention I paid towards her? What could she have thought of me? 

We know that art is to some extent determined as such simply through the arbitrary assertion of the artworld. If we acknowledge the intersubjective nature of atmosphere, we will need to account for others. We have the chance of defining the atmosphere simply by being the one who puts it into words.

A crush is nothing other than mutual self-recognition: seeing yourself reflected in another, and at the same time seeing them recognize that they are reflecting you back at you in virtue of seeing themselves reflected back at themselves. I don't remember the first time I laid eyes on her, but from that moment my pre-self-conscious being, completely certain of its senses, perceived and understood what this being was through its training. This is pure Hegel---but how do we know that this process is really occurring? How do we know that we are not simply seeing ourselves reflected in the mechanical eye of a robot that passed the Turing test? How do we know that we are not so blinded by our own attraction, that we then project a reciprocal attraction onto the other? As in the case of the art, we need to conjecture on the basis that our instinct is correct---and see what comes of it.

# The Lord and the Lady

In Hegel's tale of the lord and bondsman, we are given two knights who meet in a forest clearing, and who are impelled to enter into a battle to the death. The story dramatizes the moment of a consciousness becoming self-conscious in its recognition of the opacity of the other. The story can be used to understand interpersonal dynamics between individuals; it can also be applied to a much grander scale and used to understand national identity and global history, as it is commonly understood that Hegel had the ongoing Haitian revolution in mind as he was writing.

Let's imagine that, in place of two burly men strapped with armour and wielding sharpened steel, ready to maim and kill, we are given a cute lord and lady. Where once the recognition of the other had given way to a masculine duel to the death, this time the opacity of the other mingles with sexual interest and gives rise to coquettish flirtation.

"M'lady," the young lord said charmingly, sweeping low in a dramatic bow from whose depth he could not help from peeping up. Looking down on him for an instant in the forest glade, she recognized someone like herself, but with certain key differences that provoked her interest.

"M'lord," said she, curtsying, and by assent of her eyes provoking his continued charm.

So it happened that they chased each other around the forest clearing for a while, laughing and tumbling in mossy nooks. Each of them represented an important royal lineage, centuries of titles and tradition fixing them to their identities in the present. Between the moments that each repeated their challenge to the other, lineage was forgotten in their innocent play. She batted her eyelashes, he ran to her, and in the thrill of the call and response both forgot everything that came before.

There came a moment, as the two passed their circuits around the clearing, when the light suddenly changed to that of twilight. The onset of eve gave them both pause; their game interrupted, she looked into his eyes and saw the fear there. It was more than an ambiguous fear of the dark: instead,
