# Sheer Being

Children cry upon waking to face the world again. Adults with uneven temperaments wake up hostile and angry. Relationships fall apart in the morning when grumpiness reveals a dissatisfaction betraying the basic premise of love. Love should be power enough to orient one's spirit, light enough to illuminate the triviality of everything cluttering the day. Work is put in its proper, subordinate place. When the lover wakes up unhappy, his mood reveals that he has turned his back on the sun and reverted to placing idols above his beloved. Money, health, ambition: love gives us respite from the harsh necessity of using instruments to cleave one's life into the world. What it offers instead is pure, leisurely enjoyment of the other.

The devout recall a prayer to mind immediately upon waking, a habit developed through constant repetition. A prayer to soothe the anxious passage from death and back to life, orienting the soul in appreciation of God's infinite power. A lifetime of practice trains the body to receive the gift of life with gratitude for the love of its creator's blessing. Devotion fortifies the vulnerable seams of consciousness with fear of God. Morning prayer grounds the spirit in praise before it has a chance to settle into whatever fallen form the chaotic world has forced it into. God is an immortal light, an infinite power that mortal men might vainly try to imitate. In fallen love, when everything has become instrumental, rust sets in and your instruments decay. Life withers when she leaves you. A mortal girl, subject to inscrutable whims just like you; it is not her fault that she could not exert the gravitational force of the sun.

For a hair's breadth before the layers of consciousness fall into place, there is a moment of sheer and immediate being. 

The sun's light powers organic life, while its gravity determines the movement of all bodies in its orbit---whether they know it or not. It is only you who forget what power guides your path; it is you who forgets the morning prayer, replacing the infinite with false idols.

You wake under a cloud of shame. In place of prayer, your body determines your first thought: *what terrible thing did I do last night*? It must have been very bad to account for the crushing sensation waiting to greet you. Restless sleep was not enough to dispel the disappointment hanging over your bed. Consciousness reborn into smoggy air. The smoke from nearby forest fires turns the sky orange and the air grey. Frustrated desire clings heavy to your chest.

Shame berates you into facing the day, drives you out of bed after a struggle, down the hall and into the kitchen where you press the button on the electric kettle. Sometimes shame is productive, a sign that you went beyond yourself---even if the effort was not well-received, still a sign following from an expression of will to power. Your body is poorly recovered, malnourished and under-slept, but your head is clear of the effects of alcohol. It takes a considerable amount of libations to bring you to the point where you can reach outside of yourself. You did not go to bed until six o'clock on Saturday morning, and then only a few hours before work. It's Sunday now, and although you wake up in a state of high stress, you are physically recovered from the weekend's drinking. A relatively easy night of only six or seven beers, and a small dose of psychedelic tea: not enough to substitute for your spinelessness. You give the cat a pet along his back, but are unable to rise immediately. It's difficult to find a reason when your life is so objectless. You are a rogue planet drifting through a space filled with orbiting bodies, but unable to form a discernible pattern with any of them. The only obligation you have is to the cat, and he's just fine. It's easier to cling to unconsciousness, or search your phone for sensation, than immediately face the day.

You open a cupboard and pull out a digital scale, a bag of coffee beans, a paper filter, the plastic cone it sits in, and a hand-crank grinder. You take a short glass resembling a laboratory beaker, measure 18 grams of the light brown beans. The smell they collect inside their paper bag is like warm-roasted, sulfurous loam. You turn the crank on the grinder until the last one has been crushed into an even powder. You dampen the filter in its conical plastic holder, position it over the black and gold mug on top of the scale, level the grounds, and tare the weight. The kettle has a thin, goose-neck spout, so you can evenly wet the coffee with precisely 50 grams of water. As you count down thirty seconds, bubbles form and pop on the surface, which turns from light to dark brown. The gas has dissipated, and you pour the rest of the water, leaving just enough space to top with milk and turn the watery black creamy tan.

Our routines form patterns forced by concrete structures. Institutions bring us into proximity with each other in public, and these relationships we form are parasocial. is often brought about in the impersonal necessity of public institutions. The social body is an organism, we its cells, responding to stimuli in a synthetic series of programmed responses. In our private capacity, we are something else. Something opaque. Your internal cosmos is structured around a constellation of crushes. The beautiful women you have come into contact with---in whom you thought you recognized something---and for whom you will nurse a secret fantasy. One for the girl at the coffee shop you go to more often than you can afford. You served her at her staff party last year, flirted as you poured her glass after glass of pink wine; but when you saw her again in the autumn, you didn't mention anything and now the chance has passed. But you still like to see her smile, and to remember fondly when, only half a year ago, you were capable of a full-on humanism.

Although you notice women instantly, it might take weeks before you remember that you are not invisible. This is when you are reminded that women are not blank screens for you to project your consciousness onto. They are, in fact, real people whose reality exists outside of your mind.

# Self-consciousness

It only took a few rotations before you began to notice Jules. You sit behind her in class, and can't avoid seeing the screen of her ThinkPad. The same model as yours: a computer-lover's computer. When she pulls up her browser, you notice the New Tab page, and it gives you something to think about. You consider whether the loud green text, reminding her to "close this page and go back to what you were doing" is kitschy and unattractive. It's winter outside, freezing cold and snowy. The feeble sun rises late and sets early. You are adrift in the darkness and snow flurries; the cold causes you to shiver and hug yourself. Most of Tuesday is spent inside sunless plastic rooms lit by fluorescent bulbs. It is the habit of your embittered heart to snap up any chance to hold yourself at a distance from others. But this time you stay neutral. The screen doesn't flash up too often to become a nuisance to you, because she's smart and focused on her notes. Before your consciousness become aware of her, your corporeal self had already seen itself reflected in her during that brief moment between sensation and sheer being. Already your body was shifting gravitational stabilizers to orient itself in her direction.

Normally all you see of her is the woodland-patterned sweatshirt she wears almost every week, hood up to hide in. You've seen enough of her face to know that she is truly the kind of person who would wear a hood indoors without pretension, and you don't count this additional consideration against her. With each of these decisions to not sink lower into your cynical foam, but instead to maintain a balance of favourable disposition, you are walking further down a path of sympathetic alignment. With each weekly rotation, when her unknown ecliptic brings her back into proximity, a desire begins to awaken: to know about the mysterious paths she takes through the rest of her week.

The Hegel course is from 6 to 8:15pm in the basement of the FG building on Ste-Catherines. A lesser mall on the downtown strip, partly converted into classrooms. The commercial areas have been redone so that the mid- and upper-levels are glossy, designed for maximal seating and open to students. Descending into the basement is like descending into hell. The escalator is broken, the two flights of stairs trafficked by parallel streams of souls moving from damnation to resurrection. The wall at the bottom of the stairs is entirely mirrored, likely to increase visibility in the excessively dim lighting. A dance group of four or five girls is practising here when class lets out, distorted pop music echoing from a cellphone's tinny speakers. The mingled smell of rotting garbage and sewage hits you as you turn the corner into the main basement. They keep the refuse from the mall restaurants down here. Down the segmented corridor that stretches an entire city block, the interior opens into a strangely cavernous atrium that was once a movie theatre. High ceilings, shadows cast by dim light, and the stink of trash join together to create a malicious hall. Most of the classes in this pit are consigned to Engineering students, the most numerous at the tables here. There are large puddles of standing water. The trash bins overflow with soda cans and fast food containers. A draft of sewage blows from the toilets; you notice, week after week, the same stall is always silently occupied, the same pair of shoes visible under the door.

PHIL 486 is cross-listed between undergraduate and graduate-level students, and is populated by undergraduate students in the late stages of their degrees, as well as a number of students in the department's two-year Masters program. Led by Professor Angelova, the syllabus consists of the *Phenomenology of Spirit* divided over thirteen weeks. Certain sections are omitted, including, very questionably, "Force and the Understanding." The third of the opening chapters, it is an absolutely essential turning point in Hegel's theory of consciousness. Indeed, it is the stage of the dialectic at which consciousness emerges. It is where the metaphysics of Hegelian ontology are expounded; a section that Deleuze would pick up on in his theory of force in *Nietzsche and Philosophy*.

The room is wide and narrow. A far-off din of amplified voices can be discerned through the white walls. The seating creaks unbearably when anyone shifts in their seat. Professor Angelova tumbles into her lectures unpredictably, breathlessly moving pell-mell from opening remarks into lecture. She makes extensive use of the blackboard. Arrows drawn in chalk connect one keyword or paragraph number to another. 

The society of the class is dominated by one particular clique that you look at from behind. Young and stylishly dressed, often arriving late or just in time. Seven of them who talk among themselves loudly, swearing and discussing their personal lives for all of us outsiders to hear. A performance for our benefit; or, as in youth, the product of overbearing candour. When everything feels as vital and important as it does in one's early 20s, propriety appears as an impossible gulf. There is simply no distinction between private and public selves, because youth do not have a fully-formed self, much less a bifurcated one. 

Daisy is on the inside, but she's 27 and grew up with money. She's old enough and well-trained enough to keep her life compartmentalized when she chooses to. She chats with you a few times during the break, but always alone. The foam of your cynicism cushions you from the hurtful sense of exclusion. You look just like these people; you have the same interests: that's why you're auditing the Hegel course. You show up more regularly than many of the students who are paying, but your status as a non-enrolled student adds to the sense of exclusion and outsiderness. But they don't know anything about you, because you never speak---you don't post your poems on the class message-board---you don't give a presentation. Instead, as the weeks wear on, you retreat further and further into your shell, so that the few times you did manage to interject into the class discussions seems like a more and more distant memory. The cynicism is there to protect you by maintaining distance. Most of all, it gives you distance from yourself, for it is you and you alone who are to blame for her not knowing your name. Because you look down on them, you are able to not feel bad for not being part of the cool group. The boys are all contemptible, more transparently arrogant and proud than you ever were at that age---except for one well-dressed, handsome young man with a shaved head. His name is Elliot. He pulls a small, new-looking Apple laptop from his bag, but writes in a thick, full-sized notebook. His pen case is a slim pouch of aged brown leather.

In the first weeks of the class, when group dynamics have not solidified with you on the outside, you speak. The topic is sense-certainty, the movement from "immature" sense-certainty to "mature" sense-certainty. Elliot speaks in a calm and collected tone, well-projected but not too loud, clearly articulating what he understands and not overextending his reach into the unknown.

"The movement to 'mature' sense-certainty seems to be a linguistic operation."

"I like these terms mature and immature, because it's true that there is a movement in the section. For the moment of sheer being that sense-certainty refers to, we experience being as such, without mediation. However, for consciousness to refer to such a moment implies an act of duration. The fact is that time, duration in the act of pointing, is what leads to the development from immature to mature sense-certainty. It's not so much a question of linguistics."

Jules speaks, pivoting her swivel chair so that she is parallel to the front of the class and can make eye contact with you.

"I think it's important what you said about sense-certainty, because I think it gives us a way to critique the idea that the way sense-certainty falls away, is any kind of absolute thing---anything spiritual, that could take the place of God."

# Atmosphere

You have little impression of her body until one Tuesday evening, weeks later but just as dark and cold as ever, you notice something different. This is the precise moment when your awareness of her moves from subterranean to above-ground. This is when you notice that she's had her nails done. Clear and purple-tipped. That's your colour. The New Tab page was girlish, but this is feminine. You finally notice that she is a woman.

You forgot about Jules, somewhat. Assumed you would never see her again once school was out. Until seeing her the other night. Seeing her again makes you remember sitting behind her in Hegel class for months on end. It is simultaneously a callback to an infernal period of your life, when you were a damned soul---but also a callback to when your life had meaning, briefly: hope in the potential of a crush. An object that you could orient yourself around. Noticing her nails one day; noticing the way she played with her hair another. These concrete elements that stick out in my memory don't matter. What does matter is the *recognition of recognition*.

When we talk about "atmosphere," how do we discern between our projections and a trans-subjective phenomena? When I write that the atmosphere in this class was infernal, a weekly reminder of my own disappointment in myself, a weekly moment of hate, how can I possibly assert that this was truly the atmosphere of the room? Of course, everything is a matter of projection. When we try to describe the unconscious affective tone of a room, something suspended between social agents, something in the air, we are not in the realm of quantifiable properties. There is no theoretical principle that we can hang an assertion on, other than the fact that every room has some atmosphere. We are discussing qualities of the room. How can I say that the atmosphere in this room is oppressive? Sometimes it's obvious; other times, less so. In this case, I can see that this room was constituted by a co-mingling of atmospheres. Mine is not the only one; the cool kids clique brought their own powerful charge with them. It overrode everything else, such that it was clear that the boys at its centre were not attuned to anyone outside their circle. But she was on the edge of that circle. Did she ever notice my depression, or the attention I paid towards her? What could she have thought of me? 

We know that art is to some extent determined as such simply through the arbitrary assertion of the artworld. If we acknowledge the intersubjective nature of atmosphere, we will need to account for others. We have the chance of defining the atmosphere simply by being the one who puts it into words.

A crush is nothing other than mutual self-recognition: seeing yourself reflected in another, and at the same time seeing them recognize that they are reflecting you back at you in virtue of seeing themselves reflected back at themselves. I don't remember the first time I laid eyes on her, but from that moment my pre-self-conscious being, completely certain of its senses, perceived and understood what this being was through its training. This is pure Hegel---but how do we know that this process is really occurring? How do we know that we are not simply seeing ourselves reflected in the mechanical eye of a robot that passed the Turing test? How do we know that we are not so blinded by our own attraction, that we then project a reciprocal attraction onto the other? As in the case of the art, we need to conjecture on the basis that our instinct is correct---and see what comes of it.

# The Lord and the Lady

In Hegel's tale of the lord and bondsman, we are given two knights who meet in a forest clearing, and who are impelled to enter into a battle to the death. The story dramatizes the moment of a consciousness becoming self-conscious in its recognition of the opacity of the other. The story can be used to understand interpersonal dynamics between individuals; it can also be applied to a much grander scale and used to understand national identity and global history, as it is commonly understood that Hegel had the ongoing Haitian revolution in mind as he was writing.

Let's imagine that, in place of two burly men strapped with armour and wielding sharpened steel, ready to maim and kill, we are given a cute lord and lady. Where once the recognition of the other had given way to a masculine duel to the death, this time the opacity of the other mingles with sexual interest and gives rise to coquettish flirtation.

"M'lady," the young lord said charmingly, sweeping low in a dramatic bow from whose depth he could not help from peeping up. Looking down on him for an instant in the forest glade, she recognized someone like herself, but with certain key differences that provoked her interest.

"M'lord," said she, curtsying, and by assent of her eyes provoking his continued charm.

So it happened that they chased each other around the forest clearing for a while, laughing and tumbling in mossy nooks. Each of them represented an important royal lineage, centuries of titles and tradition fixing them to their identities in the present. Between the moments that each repeated their challenge to the other, lineage was forgotten in their innocent play. She batted her eyelashes, he ran to her, and in the thrill of the call and response both forgot everything that came before.

There came a moment, as the two passed their circuits around the clearing, when the light suddenly changed to that of twilight. The onset of eve gave them both pause; their game interrupted, she looked into his eyes and saw the fear there. It was more than an ambiguous fear of the dark: instead,
