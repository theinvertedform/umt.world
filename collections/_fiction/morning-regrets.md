# 1. Waking up grumpy---waking up with a prayer---a girl's love vs. God's---shame---tired body---making coffee

Children cry upon waking, to be dragged unwilling from the womb of sleep and forced to face the world again. Men with uneven temperaments will wake up bitter. Relationships fall apart at the seams when his morning grumpiness reveals a dissatisfaction that betrays the implicit premise of love. Love should be light enough to orient the soul; enough to lighten the pale triviality of everything that weighs down the day. Work is put in its proper place as nothing other than a means of expressing love. If the besotted wakes up unhappy one day, such a mood reveals that he has turned his back on the nominal centre of his life and fallen into idolatry. Money, health, ambition: love gives us respite from our unfortunate obligation to these instruments, whose function is to cleave a place in the world. A bower fit to shade the beloved, a shelter from cruel necessity. Therein love's flourishing promises an earthly paradise.

The devout recall a prayer to mind immediately upon waking. A habit ingrained through constant repetition. A prayer to soothe the spirit's anxious passage from deathlike womb back into the waking world. Practice trains the body to receive the gift of Being with an appropriate mixture of fear and gratitude. Devotion fortifies the vulnerable seams of consciousness with the power of the Absolute. In that slice of time upon waking---at the moment of sheer being---prayer grounds the spirit in exultation before it has a chance to settle into whatever fallen form the chaotic world has forced us into. 

Unlike a mortal lover's, God's love is infinite: a sustenance subject to principles ultimately unknowable, but certainly immutable. When everything in life has been reduced to an instrument, the instrument suffers overuse. Rust sets in and decay begins. She leaves you, and the home you hollowed out in the side of the world slips into ruin. A mortal girl ruled by an opaque and arbitrary will---just like your own.

In place of a grounding prayer, your body's habit of shame determines your first thought: *what terrible thing did I do last night*? It must have been very bad to account for the crushing sensation waiting to greet you upon waking. Restless sleep was not enough to dispel the cloud of disappointment hanging over your bed. Consciousness is reborn into the smoke from nearby forest fires that turn the air grey and the sky a hellish orange. Frustrated desire clings heavy to your chest. A power that wants to reach outward, it collapses instead into unhappy self-negation.

The shame berates you into facing the day. It drives you out of bed after a struggle, down the hall and into the kitchen where you press the button on the electric kettle. Sometimes shame is productive, a positive indication that you went outside yourself---even if not well-played, the memory of her face is a sign that she saw you. Your body is poorly recovered, malnourished, under-slept, over-worked, but clear of the lingering grogginess that follows into the morning after heavy drinking. It's Sunday now; you wake up in a state of high stress, but physically recovered from Friday night. Only six or seven beers, together with a small dose of mushroom tea. Not enough of a crutch to substitute for your spinelessness. You give the cat a pet down his back. Sometimes it's impossible to rise, too Godless and loveless to orient yourself. The only object in the void is the shame berating you into facing the day.

You open a cupboard and pull out a digital scale, a bag of coffee beans, a paper filter and the plastic cone it sits in, together with a hand-crank grinder. You take a short glass whose shape recalls a laboratory beaker, use it to measure 18 grams of the brown beans. The smell that collects inside their paper bag is like warm-roasted, sulfurous loam; like something that grows under cumulus clouds in the rich black earth on the side of a volcano. You turn the crank on the grinder until the last one has been crushed into an even powder. You dampen the filter in its plastic funnel, position it over the black and gold Scorpio mug on top of the scale, level the grounds, and tare the weight. The kettle has a thin, goose-neck spout, so you can evenly wet the coffee with just 50 grams of water. As you count down thirty seconds in your head, bubbles form and disappear on the surface of the damp coffee grounds. Their colour goes from light brown to dark brown as the water drains away. The gas held in the beans has dissipated, and you pour the rest of the water, leaving just enough space to top with milk and turn the watery black a creamy tan.

With your coffee in hand, you sit in the sunlight on the front stoop and recite your morning prayer. *Jules*, you whisper into your phone; but it remains black.

# 2. Hailed, and you ignore her---your public self---a constellation of parasocial crushes

Friday night's precise moment of failure appears before you like a hologram projected before your mind's eye. She saluted you across the crowd, and you returned the gesture; on passing, you bravely resisted turning your head towards her. Her proximity in the private realm of a party inspires such fear in you that your heart begins to pound, just from running the gauntlet of the alley back to the venue. Instead of talking to her, you entered the room and continued as though you wanted nothing other than to remain alone. But the room is different: she's there, occasionally lit up by the strobe lights, and she's someone you want to be with. You're close enough to hear the sound of her voice as she continues her conversation with another man. He seems free of fear; your entire being is oriented around it. Week after week for four months you sat next to her, observing her closely, becoming transfixed by her power. In those moments when you felt like she was seeing you, suddenly the roar of the order-word would rise up. A deafening metallic gong that drowned out all sound, blackened your vision, its vibrations subjugating your will until all you could do is put your head down and squeeze. On a few occasions, when you caught sight of the colour of her aura, your nervous system's response to its brilliant colour was to instantly go colourblind, the world rendered in greyscale. The fear trains your body by auto-shock therapy to ignore her. Now, here in private, where you are licensed to act in your own name, you slip back into the habit of self-preservation. Like a head in a jar, no nerve endings, no sensation. She greeted you, and you pretended not to see her, so she could only move on to the one who showed an actual interest in her.

It was thanks to the public institution of Concordia University that you were brought into proximity with her. Your public self is absolutely closed off. In our private capacity, we have the opportunity to be ourselves absent all the accumulated layers of social mediation. The private self is the dark side of our celestial body, unseen by those in parallel ecliptics. However, when two bodies sink into orbit, they revolve around each other like the hermaphroditic twins from Plato's *Symposium*. Two re-joined into their whole form as one, travelling leagues by their great cartwheeling strides.

Absent family, lover, or God, your movement through life is devoid of external orientation. The North Star shines down from the night sky of yourself. A navigation by purely internally-derived object that brings you nowhere. Navigation by external landmarks is arbitrary, aimless wandering rather than a purposeful path. Your wandering through the public sphere is oriented around a map of all the beautiful women you take as urban landmarks. If you closed your eyes, you could still find your way to them through the familiar pattern of movements that conveys you there---to the bar, to the cafe, to the edge of the parasocial membrane that separates you from her. A constellation of crushes structures your routine, the heat of potential energy luring your aimless self into distant orbit. A light that shines through the velvet curtain of the night of your sky, betraying the presence of something outside of you. Inside public institutions---the university, the streets---the occasional momentary glimmer of recognition is the extent to which you are able to be sociable. These are the ones in whom you thought you recognized something---and for whom you will grow a version of yourself that will remain virtual until your dying day. Unrealized possibility. Schrodinger's love affair. One for the girl at the coffee shop you go to more often than you can afford. You were her waiter at her staff party last year, flirted as you poured her glass after glass of pink wine; but when you saw her again in the autumn, you were too confused by the pain of a half-amputated, gangrenous relationship to mention anything, and now the chance has passed. But you still like to see her smile, like to think: *she must recognize me from somewhere*; and to remember fondly that time when, only half a year ago, when you had a real body---a presence in the world. Now you're a ghost lingering over a preserved head in a jar.

# 3. Hegel in FG---a Hellish descent---the lecture hall---the syllabus

*Hegel* in the Winter semester. This was months ago from when you woke up, made your coffee, and sat in the sun. A thirteen week course on Tuesdays, from 18h--20h15 in the basement of the FG building. Once a lesser mall on Ste-Catherines, partly converted into classrooms. The upper levels, a food court turned dull from decades of tramping feet, have been re-made new and glossy. Students sit at the benches, chatting, studying, eating their take-out meals while the wraith-like figures of the downtown homeless drift amongst them. 

Like Virgil descending into Hell, you descend into the basement of the building. The escalator is broken, two flights of stairs trafficked by parallel streams of blank-faced Preterites resurrected from their temporary damnation. One of them turns his head to you, and you see that two silver ingots have been driven into his eyes. Twin streams of black, coagulated blood stand thick on his cheeks. The wall at the bottom of the stairs is entirely mirrored, an architectural feature whose function seems to be to increase visibility in the excessively dim lighting. A dance group of four or five girls is practising here when class lets out. Unfamiliar pop music echoes distorted and chaotic from a cellphone's tinny speaker. The girls move like dancing skeletons. The smell of rotting garbage mingled with sewage hits you as you turn the corner into the main passageway. Trash from the restaurants above is stored in dumpster chambers adjacent to classrooms. Down a fluorescent-lit segmented corridor stretching an entire city block, the interior opens into a strangely cavernous atrium, once a movie theatre before your time. High ceilings, shadows cast by dim light, and the stink of trash join together to create a maleficent gathering hall. Students sit uneasily at cheap tables too tall for the built-in benches. A large puddle of standing water has grown around the blocked drinking fountain. Trash bins overflow with empty cans of Monster and Red Bull, Styrofoam fast food containers coated in red and orange grease. A draft of sewage blows from the toilets; you notice, week after week, the same stall is always silently occupied, the same pair of shoes visible under the door.

The lecture hall is wide and narrow. A far-off din of amplified voices can be discerned through the white walls. The seating creaks unbearably if anyone shifts. Professor Angelova tumbles into her lectures breathlessly, moving unpredictably from opening remarks into a rushing stream of exposition. Along the way, she makes extensive use of the blackboard; through the totality of collage, trying to create a picture out of imperfectly-rendered and fleeting thoughts. Entire sentences are transcribed, then gradually over-written by arrows connecting one keyword or paragraph number to another. 

Cross-listed between the Concordia Philosophy Department's undergraduate and Masters programs, the median age is around 25, barring the few outliers standard in upper-level humanities courses. Old-timers come back to school in their golden years for one last brush with Absolute Knowing. The syllabus divides the *Phenomenology of Spirit* over twelve weeks, but omits a few sections, including "Force and the Understanding." The third of the book's opening chapters, it's a fundamental turning point in Hegel's theory of consciousness. This is the stage of the dialectic when consciousness awakens to life, following that first sliver of *sheer being*. You can see the Miller translation's iconic yellow-and-gold cover from where you lie now, paralyzed in bed, feeling famished and unable to rise. When you turn on the kettle, your eye hits the dark brown spine of Deleuze's *Nietzsche and Philosophy* on the bookshelf. Deleuze borrows heavily from "Force and the Understanding," and Angelova is a Deleuze scholar. She must have decided that an excursion into this important section would divert the course too far from the path she has cleared through the thicket.

# 4. Noticing Jules---winter---a favourable disposition---sense-certainty---Elliot the American---dialogue on sense-certainty

It takes a few rotations before you began to notice Jules. You sit behind her in class and can't avoid seeing the screen of her ThinkPad. Nor the back of her neck. The same model as yours, except newer. She's a bit younger than you. Yours is old and you try not to let it leave your desk. A computer-lover's computer. When she pulls up her browser for the first time, her New Tab page gives you something to think about. Loud green text reminds you both to "close this page and go back to what you were doing :)." 

It's winter outside. Dirty snow impedes traction out in the constant night. A feeble sun clouded by an endless snow front rises late and sets early. You are adrift in darkness: perhaps the Sun has left you too, another severed limb. You shiver and hug yourself. Most of Tuesday is spent inside sunless plastic rooms lit by fluorescent bulbs. It is the habit of your embittered heart to snap up any chance to hold yourself at a distance from others---but on this occasion, you stay neutral. The screen doesn't flash up often enough to be a nuisance. She's a better student than most. The big auditoriums are full of hundreds of students, all collectively doing their online shopping while the professor drones on like their job is to admonish. Jules stays focused on her notes. Before you begin to consciously become aware of her, you have already seen yourself reflected in her. Already you begin to shift your own orbit to mirror hers.

Most of what you see of her is the woodland hunting-patterned camo hoodie she wears almost every class, hood up to hide in. You've seen enough of her face to know that there is no pretension in wearing the hood indoors; another consideration that you choose to read charitably. Each of these decisions keeps you from sinking lower into the soft foam of cynicism, but to instead maintain a favourable disposition. Blue hands reaching for warmth, but they blend into the night and no-one can see. Each weekly rotation through the world brings her back into proximity; and just like the world is powered for the desire to see what will happen next in the unfolding, you are kept moving by the desire to know what paths she takes through the rest of her life.

In the first weeks of class, when group dynamics have not concretized, you speak. The topic is sense-certainty. It's the point at the very beginning of consciousness---a point that never happens in reality---where we have not moved from the very first moment. That movement happens in the apprehension of Something---it doesn't matter what: *cogito ergo sum*. Consciousness in its barest theoretical form passes from "immature" immediacy to "mature" immediacy. That's what Elliot calls the two stages present in the chapter. His brown leather pencil case lies on the desk next to you, holding a fountain pen that he uses to write in a large, hardcover black notebook. But he also uses a thin and new-looking Macbook. What gets written by hand, what gets typed to a file? It's all held in a blue pleather tote. You have a similar bag, but in red and made from a crispy synthetic. Your long stringy hair is unlike his shaved pate. All these designer accoutrement belie the modesty of his speech. This class is filled with high-level individuals, the kind of sincere characters that are rare to come upon outside of the classroom.

Elliot, who comes from his American kingdom, has nothing to prove. Nothing could draw one to a program as unspectacular as the Concordia Philosophy MA other than a true love of wisdom; and that love, paradoxically for the institute, creates an academic community committed to basic principles. In principle: in reality, self-serving individualists with a power complex (sophists, ancient enemy of the philosopher) are just as incentivized to pursue studies at Concordia. Instead of over-extending his reach, as substitutes for "mediated," given that sense-certainty is always immediate. How consciousness is able to process the This without recourse to mediation is a question of the text. This is how the immature speak: incomprehensibly, trying to exercise their own knowledge by stretching it to the limit; or, worse, trying to disguise their lack of understanding through complexity---rather than trying to lay a clear base for others to build on.

"There seem to be two distinct stages of sense-certainty, but that movement doesn't happen through mediation because sense-certainty is always immediate. So based on Hegel's discussion around the This, the movement between these two stages of consciousness, at this level, seems to be a linguistic operation. At least, that's the best I can make of it."

"I like these terms mature and immature, because it's true that there is a movement in the section. For the moment of sheer being that sense-certainty refers to, we experience being as such, without mediation. However, for consciousness to refer to such a moment implies an act of duration. The fact is that time, duration in the act of pointing, is what leads to the development from immature to mature sense-certainty. It's not so much a question of linguistics."

Jules speaks, pivoting in her swivel chair so that she is parallel to the front of the class and can make sideways eye contact with you.

"I think it's important what you said about sense-certainty, because I think it gives us a way to critique the idea that the way sense-certainty falls away, is any kind of absolute thing---anything spiritual, that could take the place of God."

The immediate knowledge of sense-certainty is as reassuring as a dream; and it falls away in the manner of a dream as the layers of consciousness settle into place. Is there God hidden here? At the beginning of consciousness, it's an important question. What is the surface that the timeless moment proceeds from, if not the divine? It could only be the movement of history.

# 5. Intercepted by Vera---did Jules recognize you?---*Thus Spoke Zarathustra*

As you are scurrying through the stinking halls after class, heading back to the slush and dark, Vera is already there to intercept you.

"I have your book. I wanted to give it back," she says softly, not looking at you. She might admit that she's afraid, but she will not admit that she's afraid of you. She's acting like an abused housewife in a 50s melodrama. Fitting for her Italian heritage. The cycle begins and ends with your abusive behaviour. You can admit it; in fact, it gives you a sick satisfaction to admit it even if she won't. Seeing her averted gaze, hearing her tremulous voice reminds you of your guilt.

"Okay," you bite off. Your thoughts are still somewhere else. What did that look Jules gave you signify? Is it possible that you saw what you think you did in the side of her eye? What you don't think is why are you thinking about someone who is not there, when there is someone in front of you. How can you trust yourself to judge another's affective vocabulary of gestures---all those unsaid, yet still expressed emotional energies, flowing, halting this way and that? Your entire existence remains unsaid; you are invisible. And yet, Vera is still here, trying to capture your attention and consequently plaguing you with guilt.

Vera un-slings her backpack and pulls your copy of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* from the top compartment. The Kaufman translation; the existentialist translation. This is your third copy of the book. The first one you bought as a teenager, and kept through your first breakup. Reading it adjacent to *On the Road* motivated you to climb mountains---to pack a bag and start hitchhiking, riding freight trains across the United States, up the west coast, and back across Canada. The subsequent copies were each purchased in the wake of a break up, when you clutched at it desperately, like a life preserver. Last year, when the leaves were turning, you came to after a sleepless night much like this one; wracked with anxiety and heartbreak, you jumped out of bed as soon as the sun was up and ran to The Word. Waited out front for an hour before they opened. They had a copy: you clutched it like a life preserver. When you would have taken the emptiness of waking, grasping for an object that you can't find. Instead, then you would wake gasping for air like a fish on the side of a boat. *Where is she*? One hot summer day, after another restless sleep you ran to the store and waited there until it opened, clutching a copy of *Beyond Good and Evil* to your heart. Not the same, but the best you had. The sibilance of the em-dashes and exclamation marks are like a life preserver that you clutch to when drowning.

# 6. Class society---Daisy the chieftain---Dialogue with Daisy

The class society is dominated by a clique that you observe from behind. Jules is a *de facto* member, but you don't hold it against her. Young and consistently styled, often arriving late, the seven talk among themselves loudly, swearing and discussing their personal lives, a spectacle for all of us outsiders to marvel at. You don't give them the same benefit of the doubt as you do to Jules. Their performance is the product of overbearing candour; or, as Kant would say, an immaturity that does not heed the distinction between public and private. In youth, everything feels vital and important; propriety appears as an impossible gulf. There is no compartmentalization between selves, because the youth is still in the process of forming a single identity, much less a bifurcated one. 

Daisy is chieftain of the tribe. She's 27 and grew up with money. She's old enough and well-trained enough to keep her life compartmentalized when she chooses to. Evidence of this is how she chats with you during the break: always when the others have left. The cushion of your negativity cushions you from the hurtful sense of exclusion. You look just like these people; you have the same interests: that's why you're auditing the Hegel course. You show up more regularly than many of the students who are paying, but your status as a non-enrolled student is an aid to your sense of exclusion and outsiderness. But they don't know anything about you, because you never speak---you don't post your poems on the class message-board---you don't give a presentation. Instead, as the weeks wear on, you retreat further and further below the surface, so that the few times you did manage to interject into the class discussions becomes more and more of a distant memory. The cynicism is there to protect you by separating yourself. Most of all, it gives you distance from yourself, for it is you and you alone who are to blame for her not knowing your name. Because you look down on them, you are able to not feel bad for not being part of the cool group. The boys are all contemptible, more transparently arrogant and proud than you ever were at that age---except for one well-dressed, handsome young man with a shaved head. His name is Elliot. He pulls a small, new-looking Apple laptop from his bag, but writes in a thick, full-sized notebook. His pen case is a slim pouch of aged brown leather.

One day, maybe a month into class, Daisy speaks to you during the break. You scurried through the hall of the damned, like a rat along the edge of the lake of hell. She accosts you where the hall narrows.

"Hey! Do you think we will get the reading group back up?"

"Maybe---I'm not sure." She's asking you because you were the host, and it's the result of your neglect that the group dissolved. However, from your perspective, it is just as much the result of their having abandoned you. No-one bothered to follow up when you stopped sending the invites. There was no mutuality in the relation: it was entirely one-sided.

"Do you miss it?"

You hesitate for a moment, looking down at her. You want to reach across the gulf and let her know that you blame her just as much as she blames you. You want her to know that she has hurt you, but because she has pushed you out of her private life---you can only show her your public face. You give her the truth, unable to do otherwise, but offer nothing more.

"Yes. Do you?"

"Yeah, I do."

# 7. The Body of Jules---forgetting, then remembering---atmosphere---a crush is mutual recognition

You have little impression of her body until one Tuesday evening. Weeks have passed, but it's just as dark and cold as ever when you notice something different. She's had her nails done. This is the precise moment when your awareness of her moves from subterranean to above-ground. Clear and purple-tipped. That's your colour. The New Tab page was girlish, but this is feminine. She is a woman.

In the months since the end of semester, you forgot about her as much as possible. Assumed you would never see her again once school was out. Then, shockingly, you saw her at your favourite after-hours venue. It brings you back to sitting behind her in Hegel class for months on end. Simultaneously a callback to your infernal damnation---but also a callback to when your life had meaning, briefly: hope in the potential of mutual recognition. An object that you could orient yourself around. Noticing her nails one day; noticing the way she played with her hair another. These concrete elements that stick out in your memory are less important than the *recognition of recognition*.

You choke down two pieces of toast and go to work. The sun is shining and it's getting too warm to wear a jacket during the day. Work doesn't matter---you have an out-of-body experience and it passes in a blur. Afterwards, sitting on a concrete lump that signifies the pedestrianization of the street for the summer-time, you raise your phone to your face.

"*Jules*," you whisper into it for the second time that day. The screen lights up and her name appears before you. A picture of a cloud in a grey-blue sky. Just this avatar is enough to change certain aspects of your impression of her, but by-and-large it solidifies the impression you have already formed. It fits, just like everything does, because you are pre-disposed to seeing all of her actions as of a piece.

You click on the message icon. Is this the right thing to do? 

*I sat behind you in Hegel class. I remember thinking your New Tab page was cute. What's up?*

When I write that the atmosphere in this class was infernal, a weekly reminder of my own disappointment in myself, a weekly moment of hate, how can I possibly assert that this was truly the atmosphere of the room? Of course, everything is a matter of projection. When we try to describe the unconscious affective tone of a room, something suspended between social agents, something in the air, we are not in the realm of quantifiable properties. There is no theoretical principle that we can hang an assertion on, other than the fact that every room has some atmosphere. We are discussing qualities of the room. How can I say that the atmosphere in this room is oppressive? Sometimes it's obvious; other times, less so. In this case, I can see that this room was constituted by a co-mingling of atmospheres. Mine is not the only one; the cool kids clique brought their own powerful charge with them. It overrode everything else, such that it was clear that the boys at its centre were not attuned to anyone outside their circle. But she was on the edge of that circle. Did she ever notice my depression, or the attention I paid towards her? What did she think of me? *Another staring boy.*

We know that art is to some extent determined as such simply through the arbitrary assertion of the artworld. If we acknowledge the intersubjective nature of atmosphere, we will need to account for others. The artist has an opportunity to define the atmosphere simply by being the one who puts it into words.

A crush is nothing other than mutual self-recognition: seeing yourself reflected in another, and at the same time seeing them recognize that they are reflecting you back at you in virtue of seeing themselves reflected back at themselves. How do we know that we are not so blinded by our own attraction, that we then project a reciprocal attraction onto the other? As in the case of the art, we need to conjecture on the basis that our instinct is correct---and see what comes of it.

You send the message and straighten your spine. Nothing will come of it, except that going beyond oneself is a good-in-itself.
