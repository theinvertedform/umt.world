description: Daniella and Marc are two millennials trying to find love. She's economizing, while he's holding out for the big payday.
---

The story is structured around Marc and Daniella meeting at Bishop's for a millennial-themed trivia night. They tell stories about their love lives, which are then recounted in flashback. We need to add something to this structure---we need a narrative to unfold in the present timeline that bears on the past. Daniella's stories are the near-past, but they don't qualify as being past enough. This narrative---perhaps having to do with friendship---is what will form the story's negation of the negation.

The non-fictional angle of the piece has to do with parasocial membranes and politics, and the possibility of puncturing either.

# Trivia Night

The crystal palace is now underwater, drowned in the ectoplasmic substance of the parasocial. Once it was a membrane that grew up like moss in the crevices of the modern city---an invisible border symbolically represented in the bar that separates staff and customer---the dynamic that has defined urban life for centuries. The parasocial also functions as an aqueous humour that joins individuated components together into a single body. A body composed out of separate cells, all joined together through the conductivity of proximity. The same substance regulates the external world, the body of the population; as well as the internal humours of the citizens. A nutritive fluid that gives us our daily dose of nutrients. An aggressively transparent substance that seeps through the pores of concrete blocks and human flesh, saturating the plate glass and iron beams of the crystal palace---as well as the bodies of the citizen.

Over the centuries, the modern subject has evolved to breathe through this quasi-liquid substance. The modern human organism has evolved to not be able to breathe without the fluid medium of parasociality. Each composite organism breathing in and out through the substance. The social body made up of many individuals, all of whom together are represented in a general consensus. The membrane brings our suspended bodies into frozen proximity to friends, lovers, comrades, enemies. Tantalizingly proximate, out of reach, but the translucency of the membrane allures the spirit with the tantalizing possibility of puncture.

Work was finishing up and they were changing shoes for boots, pulling on hats and scarves. Luis, who worked on the cold side, asked Marc what he was up to that evening.

"Not much. I might go to the *bain vapeur* and try to relax. How about you?"

"Well, I'll wait for Abraham to finish, then we'll smoke a joint, have a few more beers, as we normally do."

They were both moving with a suppressed vigour, speaking with forced casualness while studiously ignoring the elephant in the room. Audrey, putting on her hat, coat, and scarf. Marc and she both had to walk in the same direction. Would they today? Her cheeks always glowed prettily in the cold, and he could count on a few more laughs before they parted at the corner with Cafe Pista. He wanted to spend more time with her---it felt so obvious that there was still more pleasure to be drawn from each other---but could not bear the thought of *appearing* as though he wanted to. Not to her, but to Luis and anyone else who might be watching. Both for her sake, and for that of his friend in the kitchen. It was a fear of looking desperate, but also of competition. He wanted to preserve his air of being detached from anyone in particular in order to be theoretically attachable to anyone. The two of them had walked these few blocks after work before, but he couldn't bring himself to make it happen when there were so many eyes on him.

Marc wound up walking alone down Beaubien towards St-Laurent. The late winter sun was angled low in the sky, shining in his eyes and on the crowds filling the narrow Sunday afternoon sidewalk. *In the Aeroplane Over the Sea* had come up on shuffle over a week ago, and he couldn't stop listening to the album over and over again. Nostalgia for a time before his own used to be the aesthetic claim of the millennial, but the taste for the simulacra had ratcheted up to an unprecedented degree by the new youth. The millennial was still attached to the slacker culture of the 90s. In this thirties, the younger Gen Z seemed completely uprooted, free-falling through time. 

The sun was setting. It was warm for January. Turning south on St-Laurent, he glanced over at Salle Climatisee and wondered for the thousandth time how he could get a job there. Further south, the water tower on top of the Saint Lawrence Warehouse stood out against the pale grey-blue sky.

*Semen stains the mountaintops...*

Passing under the viaduct, he sat for a moment on the blue bench in front of Pastel Rita and let the song finish. It was too emotional to turn off in the middle.

Inside, the room was warm and humid. Smooth French house played on the stereo and the girl he liked wasn't there. But he liked Leo second best.

"I'll take a grog, please," Marc said as he shed his coat and sat at the dark green bar.

Leo stared at him blankly.

"A *what*?"

"A grog," he repeated, hitting the final "g." It's not the first time the francophones behind the bar misunderstood "grog" for "*grand*."

"Ohh---a grog. Yes, of course. Sorry, I feel like we never sell those so I'm just not used to hearing it."

"Hey, I sold four today!" the girl at the bar piped up. She was relaxing with a salad after her shift.

The drink was delicious. Hot apple and spices mixed with scotch. It burned pleasantly down the esophagus, a perfect winter afternoon warm-up.

After drinking his drink, reading a chapter from *The Age of Innocence* and rolling a spliff, Marc set off down Bernard towards Parc Ave. As he passed by his apartment on the corner of St-Urbain, he looked only at the third floor apartment above his own, wondering what the girls were up to.

He arrived at the YMCA du Parc around 5:30pm, leaving him just 30 minutes to hit the steam room. He entered as it was already mid-cycle, and it only took him a few minutes to reach complete heat saturation. A cold plunge right away, then another fifteen minutes to relax and try to clear his mind. 

Sunday is the lord's day, and although Marc had begun to put a lot of his identity into being a religious man, an urban monk, Sunday stuck out as an important signifier of the movement from one cycle to the next. He used ritual to keep moving: without it, there was a genuine fear that he might simply---stop moving entirely. Whither away alone, never seen or heard from again. But a life that depends entirely on ritual is a life that is rigid and brittle, liable to break and crumble the moment a routine is knocked from its foundation.

He took a walk, killing time before he was due to meet Daniella at Bishop \& Bagg for trivia night. Just down to the mountain, just far enough to breathe in the air of its lawn before turning back up Clark. 

He passed Chateau Clark and took a moment to think about everyone who had ever lived there. Erika, Tyrone, Shayna, Rachelle, Owen.

Inside Bishop, he stood by the door and waited for the server to notice him.

"We're in a bit of a transitional period...most of the room is reserved, but a lot of these people are about to leave. I'll have a table for two in a few minutes, if you want to wait."

Marc sat at one of the bars that divided the room in two and waited. Two guys sat next to him, also waiting. People got up to leave, then the three staff members spent a few minutes organizing the tables.

"You can choose whichever one of those tables," the server told him. He chose the one next to the window and sat facing the door. It was 7pm, when Daniella said she would meet him, but there was not a chance she would be on time. He sat there nervously as the pub began to fill up in anticipation of the night's events. Instead of looking around him, he pulled out a small black notebook and wrote: *Daniella is a valuable friend, but I don't trust her. She's a flake. Even though she just texted me that she's on her way, I truly have no idea if she will actually show up.*

***

But she did show up, only 20 minutes late.

"Here you go! Happy birthday slash Christmas!" She handed him a bag, its contents loosely covered by a single piece of tissue paper.

Inside were three items: a dual-language edition of poems by Pier Paolo Pasolini; a pair of large black insulated mittens; and a cycling cap by Mountain Hardwear. Each gift was very well chosen. Pasolini, a communist filmmaker near to his heart; the mittens, appropriate for biking in the winter; the hat didn't fit---they rarely did---but it was a callback to the down jacket of the same brand that he had left at her apartment earlier in the winter.

"It's over with Eric," Daniella began. "I have to tell you this insane story. So he was texting this girl..."

At that moment, the music awkwardly transitioned from background-level bar music, to Sum 41 playing at a jarringly unexpectedly loud volume. Just a snatch of "Small Things" before the volume dropped back down and the hostess's voice cut through on the microphone.

"Alright! It's time to get started."

# 2012: The Year of Tinder

The boys were hanging out at a condo Oliver's mother was renting on King Street, near Bathurst. Out on the 21st floor balcony, smoking a cigarette, Rob's big belly laughed when Marc, pointing to the forest of condo towers surrounding them, asked which one Drake lived in.

"Let's listen to this, it's the best song on the new album," Marc said, scrolling through the iPod plugged in to the stereo. He selected the song "The Ride," featuring the new singer The Weeknd. Somewhat epic and melancholy for the party atmosphere, but he couldn't stop listening.

Back inside, Rob showed them something on his phone. "It's called Tinder. All you do is swipe right for like, swipe left for dislike. If you both swipe right on each other, you can message."

"Yeah, I've been using it too," Jesse said, taking his iPhone out of his jeans pocket, drink in his other hand.

"I've got to get in on this!" Marc exclaimed. He took his phone out, except it wasn't a phone, it was an iPod Touch. Still, he had just as much access to the app store as the others. It only took a few minutes for him to create an account and for his friends to take a few photos for him to break up the selfies.

"Okay," Jesse said, once he was ready, "now what I've been doing is just swiping right on everyone. That's the strategy. Swipe right on everybody, and anyone you get a match with who's hot, you can message them."

"No!" Rob exclaimed vehemently, "that's a bad strategy! It's going to ruin it for the rest of us. If everyone swipes right on everyone, then it means nothing. Women will become more selective, and we'll get fewer matches."

"But it's the best strategy," Jesse insists.

"It's antisocial!"

Meanwhile, Marc, rendered giddy by the novelty of so many attractive girls, and already having received multiple matches, wanted to swipe faster and faster---and in order to speed up the process, naturally began swiping right on each new photo. And the matches kept coming.

"Wow, you must be really hot," Oliver said.

# Noelle Is Not Into Monogamy

Marc showed up with his backpack over his shoulder, and several months' beard on his face. Vito barked and wagged his tail, wanting to know who was there.

"It's just me," he said. "Boy, you got big!"

Alex and Emma Boorman were sitting on the couch in the living room, under a blanket. It was February and the heating was barely making a dent. They looked over at him awkwardly. Marc and Emma had never met before; Alex, his best friend, acted like he hadn't been gone for five years. Like he wasn't returning from a year-long adventure out on the road.

"Luke's playing a show at Duffy's place tonight," Alex said. Marc knew who Luke was, but not Duffy, and he didn't know his "place." It turned out to be an apartment on Van Horne, fortuitously located on an odd corner, next to no-one. Duffy was committed to the lifestyle. The parties went on late, and the apartment itself was a kind of hecatomb to Dionysus.

They showed up early, before the music started, when it was still possible to be heard. Somehow Marc found himself sitting in front of the couch in the living room discussing films with a few girls. The blonde was named June, the brunette was named Noelle. About 30 minutes after they left, he couldn't contain himself.

"I'll be back in a bit," he told Alex. The party was just getting into full swing. One band had played in the living room, and the crowd was becoming more and more dense.

He ran home, only about ten minutes away at a normal pace. Opened up his laptop and found the event page for the party on Facebook. Scrolled quickly past the description, which he barely noticed seemed to be written in an alien gibberish, and loaded up the guest list. Scrolled through it only for a second before he found Noelle's name.

"Hey, I wanted to talk to you more before you left, but it's too late. Maybe we can meet up some time?"

With that, he closed the laptop and walked quickly back to the party. He could hear it from half a block away. There were a few groups of people straggling outside, but since smoking indoors was allowed, most people chose to stay inside. A red balloon was tied to the chain-link fence.

***

A few months later, he was leaving her apartment in the morning.

"There's something I need to talk to you about," he said.

"I'll walk with you a bit," she said. 

It was spring now, and most of what they did together was walk around the city. They made it a block, up to the buanderie-cafe on the corner, where they sat on some wooden benches next to a mostly-melted pile of snow.

"I need to tell you that---I want to kiss you, but I'm afraid, I really don't know how you feel about me..."

She kissed him.

"Look," she said, smiling. "I don't really want to be exclusive..."

# Eden and La plante

A year later. Winter again. Snow falling softly as he sat in an alley, sending long text messages to Noelle, knowing that she had blocked his number and would not receive them. The MDMA was hitting. He was only a block away from Duffy's place, now shut down for renovations: tonight he was going to a show at La Plante. 

Radiant Baby performed, and during the set, as he stood by himself, moving and feeling the kitschy electro-pop, a girl tapped him on the shoulder.

"Don't I know you?" she asked.

"Uh..." he looked at her closely, difficult in the dark and with his vision swimming. A vertigo overtook him, but at this point it still felt normal for someone to address him. He was still new to the city, and everything seemed to be happening so fast and furiously. This level of socializing was his only frame of reference, so for him it felt normal that a pretty girl would tap him on the shoulder in the dark, at a show in a DIY venue, and initiate a meeting.

"I don't think so," he said.

"Yeah, aren't you taking French lessons? Don't you go to the Centre Saint-Louis?"

"Holy shit! You're right, I do!" He was shocked at the fact of being recognized, because even with his small frame of reference---even feeling like it's normal that a woman would come up and talk to him, the fact of being recognized was not normal. Even now, at 25, in his glory years, he still conceived of himself as being invisible and anonymous.

"Wow! Yes, that's right!" He studied her face again. Curly dark hair down to her ears, high cheekbones and a sharp nose. He liked it.

"I recognized you," she told him.

They chatted as Radiant Baby continued through his set. It turned out that she knew him, which is what brought her to the event that night. She was there with friends.

"Who are you here with?"

"Oh, just myself."

She seemed pleasantly surprised, in itself a surprise. Impressed, showing the generosity of her spirit. The show was wrapping up and it still wasn't even 1 in the morning.

"Any plans after this?" she asked him. She saved him the responsibility of having to be the one to ask.

"I heard there was a show going on at Brasserie Beaubien, I might go to that," he said. "Want to come check it out?"

"Yeah, that sounds fun," she smiled.

When he opened the door to Brasserie Beaubien, it was still and empty. The bartender was sweeping the floor; she glared at the two of them.

"Oh, well, I guess not," he said. "We could just go across the street to NDQ and get a drink?"

"Okay!" she said, continuing her charitable streak. Luckily he had cash in his pocket. At the end of the night, he got her number. They slept in the same bed together, and he brought himself to kissing her, but couldn't bring himself to have sex. Noelle had texted him the day previously that she had tested positive for chlamydia and he was still waiting on his own test results. It wasn't until a few months into the relationship that she opened up even more. She had been dating the guy from Ought---the frontman of the sensational new band---and he had broken her heart. He was her rebound, but it turned into something more complex. She hadn't expected it.

"You're not basic," she told him.

He had never known anyone to embody the idea of "emotional intelligence" as aptly as she. She had the power to analyze everything, to break it all, to reveal the motivations that were hidden even from himself. He never would have dreamed that his body language was as transparent as she could reveal it to be. Everything became clear as she pulled the wool from his eyes; even his desire to maintain two relationships, with her and Noelle simultaneously, she could see as the symptom of the virtue of loyalty. Loyal to a fault.

One night after they spent the day together, she went off to a rave with her friends and did some drugs. He had work in the morning. Their relationship was stable enough that neither felt stressed or worried about missing out on this opportunity together---there would be other chances for them to spend time together.

It wasn't until their meeting at Cafe Olimpico that she spelled it all out.

"If you're in an open relationship...then you can only ever be in relationships with other people in open relationships..." she said.

# Eric's Last Stand

A bubble appeared from out of the circuit. "John's died," it said. Daniella's chest stung.

He died a month ago, and his parents were just beginning to circulate the news now. It had only been a month and a half since she last saw him, before Christmas. She had visited him at his small studio in the Mile Ex. The place was brand new and quite clean. It could only have been his parents who paid for the thing, since she knew that he didn't work. Just spent all day at home, working on his paintings. Sometimes they might meet in a park or pop into a store during the summer, but she so rarely saw him in public. Still less in a commercial setting.

"What have you been up to?" she asked, standing by the linoleum counter-top. She opened the wood-and-glass cupboard, pulled one of four glasses out and filled it from the Brita filter on the counter-top. Meanwhile, John sat in the chair by the window and put his feet up. Daniella took her place on the futon opposite him. The pale yellow light of a floor lamp in the corner lit up their faces with an aggravating lack of shadows.

"I've been working," he said.

"Working where?"

"Here---I stopped renting the studio. It's a new series based on the representation of the female nude in Hollywood films."

"Oh, that sounds...so much like you." She couldn't help but notice that such a series would not actually require him to interact with any aspect of the feminine that he couldn't reach from home. And of course the series could easily be his best, since he had found a way to tap into a lifetime of organic research.

Now he was dead. The message came from Lindsay, who know his parents and was passing the message along. Lindsay didn't mention the cause of death, but when Daniella spoke to her on the phone, she speculated.

"It must have been suicide," said the voice through the phone. Daniella was sitting at her desk at work.

"Do you really think he would do that? I spoke to him just a few weeks before he died, he didn't seem suicidal."

"I spoke to him like, two days before he died. He wasn't acting like the Joker or anything, he wasn't being over the top, but when I think back, he just seemed so numb---like he was removed from everything. Like he had given up."

"Yeah, you know, you're right," Daniella said as she was scrolling aimlessly through her spreadsheets. Not looking for anything, just moving the mouse wheel while her mind wandered. She had two monitors in front of her: one with her boss's expenses, the other with the company's expenses. It was her job to make sure that each of these was documented, recorded, and brought into the equation.

A few more minutes passed before she said goodbye, tapped the phone lying in front of her on the desk, and hung up. She pulled up her messages, and texted Eric:

"My friend just died. I need to see you tonight."

She called Marc, too, but he didn't pick up. There was no-one else to talk to. She wondered: if she felt numb now, and John had felt numb before he decided to end his life, then did that mean that she was close to suicidal? This feeling of numbness is a sign of something bad. Giving up and shock are close to the same thing.

Hours passed as she sat at her desk, spinning the mouse wheel, occasionally getting up to drink some water or use the bathroom. Eventually she found herself at home, surrounded by her friends. Eric sat on the white leather couch next to her; Ophelia purred behind them. Heather was in the kitchen pouring tea.

"You are the one who wanted to be in an open relationship. You wanted me to meet Yas, so it's okay if you meet her, right?" Eric was saying softly into her ear. Daniella barely heard him. She was still stuck at her desk, scrolling unseeingly, simply moving.

"You're right, it's fine," she said blandly, not understanding what she was saying yes to.

Heather entered, and her eyes immediately narrowed into slits when she saw the two of them there. Her friend, sitting unblinking, staring straight ahead, clearly in shock, while some man she didn't know whispered into her ear. He had the very posture of a wormtongue. 

"Here, take this," she declared forcefully, shoving the hot mug into her friend's hands. She sat next to her, using the weight of her body to move Daniella's centre of gravity in her direction, away from Eric. They made eye contact, and after a few minutes it seemed like Daniella was pulling out of it.

"Hey," she said, a smile moving her cheeks.

An hour later, there was a knock at the door. Eric jumped up. By that time, Erika and Jane had joined, and the atmosphere was becoming more festive. Daniella had music playing on the speaker and was holding forth animatedly to her friends. When Eric re-joined them with Melissa, things took another turn, and together with Heather and Jane she retreated into her bedroom.

"What the fuck is going on out there?" Jane asked.

"More of this open relationship bullshit," Heather said, eyes rolling angrily. The two of them were not well-disposed towards their friend's style of choosing relationships, even if they were supportive in her efforts to find love. It wasn't that either of them had particular cause to distrust Eric---sometimes, Heather even felt bad for him: it wasn't his fault, after all; he was just playing along with the terms Daniella set---but she wasn't loyal to him. She thought Daniella ought to lose him once and for all, and then move on to a more healthy and conventional relationship style. But it wasn't for her to say.

"It's fine," Daniella said, fixing her makeup in front of the wardrobe mirror. "I said he could have her over."

"You're fine with your boyfriend making out with some slut, in your apartment, the same day you hear about your friend dying?" Jane said, pulling her head back in from a peek out the door. "Because that's what's happening, girl."

"Really?"

Daniella stuck her head out the door and caught on eyeful of Eric and Melissa, sitting on the couch with their arms wrapped around each other, making out hungrily.

"I mean, what kind of girl even does that?" Erika said, bringing up the obvious.

"I know!" Heather was sitting on the edge of her bed, typing furiously into her phone, appraising her boyfriend of everything that was happening.
