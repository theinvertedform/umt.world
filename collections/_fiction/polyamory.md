title: Love and War

date: February 3, 2024--
description: Daniella and Marc are two millennials trying to find love in a post-millennial, Contemporary world. She's economizing, and he's holding out for the big payday. How will their friendship be affected?
---

> The story is structured around Marc and Daniella meeting at Bishop's for a millennial-themed trivia night. They tell stories about their love lives, which are then recounted in flashback. We need to add something to this structure---we need a narrative to unfold in the present timeline that bears on the past. Daniella's stories are the near-past, but they don't qualify as being past enough. This narrative---perhaps having to do with friendship---is what will form the story's negation of the negation.
>
> The non-fictional angle of the piece has to do with parasocial membranes and politics, and the possibility of puncturing either.

Once an exhibition hall for the wonders of the modern world, the Crystal Palace has attained the *telos* of the engineer and is now nothing more than a series of electricity towers strung together by thick, buzzing cables. The aesthetics of the masses are determined by the engineer who elbows his way to the front of the crowd. Now the thing has been drowned by the rising tides---submerged in the ectoplasm of two centuries of solidified alienation. Once the parasocial was just a membrane, something that grew up like moss in the crevices of the city. An invisible border symbolically represented in the bar that separates staff from customer. The same dynamic that has characterized urban life for centuries. The parasocial is the universal medium, an aqueous humour that joins individuated components together into a single body. Autonomous cells joined together into one lopsided thing through the conductive charge of proximity. The same substance regulates the external world, the blue humours of the general population; as well as the yellow humours of the individual citizen. A nutritive fluid that gives us our daily dose of social vitamins. The parasocial substance is aggressively transparent; it seeps through the pores of concrete blocks and human flesh, saturating plate glass and iron beams; it sits in an infrathin layer on top of the surface of our phones, and as we dip our fingers in, it crawls up our arm, turning our screams into the pleasant lull of a vocoder.

Over the hundreds and thousands of years that *homo sapiens* have been living in cities, the species has evolved a secret organ that allows it to breathe through the invisible fluid of the parasocial. Indeed, the evolution has progressed to the extent that this set of gills has come to replace the lungs in certain of our most modern subjects. The bodies of our contemporaries have changed such that they no longer know how to breathe without the aid of this medium. For better or for worse, whether we feel it or not, we are all drowning in a transparent viscosity that brings us together at the same time that it keeps us apart. The parasocial substance is conductive, and capable of representing hapticity such that we might entirely forget that our most sensual relations are mediated by distance. The distance of a bar, of a screen, of two worlds in imperfect alignment. Our world is an ocean of ectoplasm, our suspended bodies kept apart in frozen proximity to friends, lovers, comrades, enemies. Close enough to count, but always out of reach. The transparency of the medium allures the spirit with possibility---that we might break through, puncture this thing that separates us and attain some paradise of unmediated sociality.

# 2024: Trivia Night 1: Audrey

Work was finished, and they changed shoes for boots, pulled on hats and scarves. Luis, who worked on the cold side, asked Marc what he was up to that evening.

"Not much. I might go to the *bain vapeur* and try to relax. How about you?"

"Well, I'll wait for Abraham to finish, then we'll smoke a joint, have a few more beers, as we are normally doing."

From a distance, the movements of the two men resembled a knife fight between combatants who smiled casually at each other and did nothing but feint. As they feigned aggressive nonchalance, Audrey put on her things, innocent as Helen of the blood spilled in her name. The thought that turned Marc's vision red was, would they accompany each other those last few blocks? Her cheeks always glowed prettily in the cold, and he could count on a few more laughs before they parted at her corner. They stood before each other as though before a mirror, each looking at their innermost heart reflected in the eyes of the other. Despite the clarity of self-recognition, his pride held him back. He could not bear the thought of entering into competition with Luis. He wanted her to choose him without his needing to step out of the crowd. Fear of rejection was an easier explanation, but it did not account for the whole story. His pride came from an inner fear, not an outer one. Proud as he was, he wanted to preserve his autonomy. He matched Luis's casual air and refused to ask Audrey if he could walk with her because he did not want her to choose him on the basis of supplication. Instead, he wanted her to choose him on a neutral basis. The two of them had walked these few blocks after work before, but he couldn't bring himself to make it happen---not when he stood next to Luis, when Abraham was watching from the kitchen, when Mathieu sat eating at the bar.

He wound up walking alone down Beaubien. He walked west into the late winter sun, angled low in the sky, shining in his eyes and on the crowds filling the narrow Sunday afternoon sidewalk. *In the Aeroplane Over the Sea* had come up on shuffle a few weeks ago, and he couldn't stop listening to it. Nostalgia for a time before his own used to be the aesthetic claim of the millennial, but the taste for the simulacra had ratcheted up to an unprecedented degree by the new youth. The millennial was still attached to the slacker culture of the 90s. Now in his thirties, the younger generation seemed completely uprooted to him, free-falling through time, their aesthetic unified even if completely arbitrary. The millennial, by contrast, was eclectic and ironic.

The sun settled below the horizon line of the buildings lining St-Laurent. It was warm for January. Before turning south, he glanced over at Salle Climatisee and wondered again how he could regain the status that he had once held. Further south on St-Laurent, the water tower on top of the Saint Lawrence Warehouse stood out against the darkening grey-blue sky.

*Semen stains the mountaintops...*

Passing under the viaduct, he sat for a moment on the blue bench in front of Pastel Rita and let the song finish. It was too emotional to turn off in the middle.

The door scraped the floor as he entered. A gust of cold air announced his presence to Leo, who stood pouring a cappuccino on the other side of the green bar. The room was warm and humid, barely punctured by the chill Marc carried from outside. Smooth French house played on the stereo and Cat, the barista he liked most of all, wasn't there. But he liked Leo second best, and there were many other girls with bare arms for him to surreptitiously glance at.

"I'll take a grog, please," Marc said as he shed his coat and sat at the bar.

Leo stared at him blankly.

"A *what*?"

"A grog," he repeated, hitting the final "g." It's not the first time the francophones here misunderstood "grog" for "*grand*."

"Ohh---a grog. Yes, of course. Sorry, I feel like we never sell those so I'm just not used to hearing it."

"Hey, I sold four today!" the girl sitting at the bar piped up. Her hair was cut short and round, like a monk's; she was relaxing with a salad after her shift.

The drink was delicious. Hot, spicy apple cider mixed with scotch. It burned pleasantly down his throat, a perfect winter afternoon warm-up.

After finishing his drink and reading a chapter from *The Age of Innocence*, Marc rolled his spliff, paid his bill and set off down Bernard towards Parc Ave. As he passed by his apartment on the corner of St-Urbain, he looked only at the third floor apartment above his own, wondering what the girls were up to.

He arrived at the YMCA du Parc around 5:30pm, leaving him just 30 minutes to hit the steam room. He entered as it was already mid-cycle, and it only took him a few minutes to reach complete heat saturation. A cold plunge right away, then another fifteen minutes to relax in the hot, wet air and try to clear his mind. 

Having recently begun to develop his identity around religiosity and traditionalism, Marc fancied himself something like an urban monk. With Sunday being the Lord's day, it stuck out as an important sign of the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next. He used ritual to keep himself moving. Without it, he sometimes feared that he might be unable to raise himself from bed entirely. He would whither away alone, never seen or heard from again. A life that depends entirely on external support structures to keep it propped up is a sick life, one that can't support itself, liable to crumble the moment one of its grounding routines happens to be knocked out of sync.

He kept walking, killing time before he was due to meet Daniella at Bishop \& Bagg for trivia night. Down to the mountain---just far enough to breathe in the air of its earthy lawn before turning back up Clark. 

He passed Chateau Clark and took a moment to think about everyone who had ever lived there. Erika, Mitch, Shayna, Rachelle, Owen. Each of them someone he had learned from, and therefore a kind of ancestor that he tried to honour by keeping alive in his mind.

Inside Bishop, he stood by the door and waited for the server to notice him.

"We're in a bit of a transitional period. Most of the room is reserved, but a lot of these people here are about to leave. I'll have a table for two in a couple minutes, if you want to wait."

Marc sat at one of the bars that divided the room in two and waited. Two guys sat next to him, also waiting. A group of six got up to leave. The three people on staff dragged the tables around, bringing them into a new configuration before quickly cleaning and re-setting with water glasses and a QR code menu.

"You can choose whichever one of those tables," the server told him. He chose the one next to the window and sat facing the door. It was 7pm, when Daniella said she would meet him, but there was not a chance she would be on time. He sat there nervously as the pub began to fill up in anticipation of the night's popular event. Instead of looking around him, he pulled out a small black notebook and wrote: *Daniella is a valuable friend, but I don't trust her. She's a flake. Even though she just texted me that she's on her way, I truly have no idea if she will actually show up.*

***

But she did show up, only 20 minutes late.

"Here you go! Happy birthday slash Christmas!" She handed him a bag, its contents loosely covered by a single piece of tissue paper.

Inside were three items: a dual-language edition of poems by Pier Paolo Pasolini; a pair of large black insulated mittens; and a cycling cap with the Mountain Hardwear logo. Each gift was very well chosen. Pasolini was a communist filmmaker near to his heart, and the mittens were appropriate for biking in the winter. The hat didn't fit---they never did---but it was a callback to the down jacket of the same brand that he had left at her apartment earlier in the winter.

"It's over with Eric," Daniella began. "I have to tell you this insane story. So he was texting this girl all day, but then I got a call telling me that my friend died. He and I were supposed to hang out at my place, but MJ and Caitlin come over too, just to give me support. They knew John too, so we're all grieving together. Meanwhile, Eric, who barely even acknowledges the fact that I just learned that my friend killed himself, is texting this girl. He literally asks me if he can invite her over, so I said yeah, sure, of course."

"Why did you say yes?"

"I wanted to see if he would! And he did, and she comes over. So MJ and Caitlin and I are in my room, and they're on the couch getting close, but she knows that he and I are seeing each other so at one point she comes up to me and asks me if it's okay. And I tell her, I'm ethically non-monogamous, Eric and I are in an open relationship. It doesn't bother me. So then they're making out on the couch the same night that I learned that my friend just died. And later that night, when everyone's gone, we had a huge fight. And now we're broken up."

"Cruel---you're being cruel to him. You have to put him out of his misery. No man, especially not a Scorpio, is going to end a relationship. We have scarcity mindset. A Scorpio especially will suffer anything; he will always believe that there is some possibility of something more. Put a bullet in the back of his head. He's not a keeper, you haven't been together that long. Just end it, start over, and learn from your mistakes. Ethical non-monogamy is never going to work. Not if you want a fulfilling relationship. For casual things, maybe---but not for the big score."

At that moment, the music awkwardly transitioned from background-level bar music to the first bars of "Small Things" by Sum 41 at a jarringly loud volume. Just a snatch before the volume dropped back down and the hostess's voice cut through on the microphone.

"Alright everybody! It's time to get started."

# 2012: Tinder and the Beginning of the End

The boys were hanging out at a condo Oliver's mother was renting on King Street, near Bathurst. Out on the 21st floor balcony, smoking a cigarette, Rob's big belly laughed when Marc, pointing to the forest of condo towers surrounding them, wondered which one Drake lived in.

"Let's listen to this, it's the best song on the new album," Marc said, scrolling through the iPod plugged in to the stereo. He selected the song "The Ride," featuring the new singer The Weeknd. Epic and melancholy, not quite a party atmosphere, but he couldn't stop listening.

Back inside, Rob showed them something on his phone. "It's called Tinder. All you do is swipe right for like, swipe left for dislike. If you both swipe right on each other, you can message."

"Yeah, I've been using it too," Jesse said, pulling his iPhone out of his jeans pocket with his left hand while the right one held his drink.

"I've got to get in on this!" Marc exclaimed. He took his phone out---except it wasn't a phone, it was an iPod Touch. Still, he could use apps as much as the others. It only took a few minutes for him to create an account and for his friends to take a few photos, giving him some variety to break up the selfies.

"Okay," Jesse said, once he was ready, "now what I've been doing is just swiping right on everyone. That's the strategy. Swipe right on everybody, and anyone you get a match with who's hot, you message them."

"No!" Rob exclaimed vehemently, "that's a bad strategy! It's going to ruin it for the rest of us. If everyone swipes right on everyone, then it means nothing. Women will become more selective, and we'll get fewer matches. It's basic game theory. You have to think about the long-term impacts, not just your immediate satisfaction."

"But it's the best strategy," Jesse insisted.

"It's antisocial!"

Meanwhile, Marc, rendered giddy by the novelty of so many attractive girls, and already having received multiple matches, wanted to swipe faster and faster---and in order to speed up the process, he naturally stopped looking at the photos and simply swiped right on each new profile as it appeared. And the matches kept coming.

"Wow, you must be really hot," Oliver said.

# 2015: Noelle is Non-monogamous

Marc showed up with his backpack over his shoulder, and several months' beard on his face. Vito barked and wagged his tail, wanting to know who was there.

"It's just me," he said. "Boy, you got big!"

Alex and Emma Boorman were sitting on the couch in the living room under a blanket. It was November and the heating was barely making a dent. They looked over at him awkwardly. Marc didn't know Emma; Alex, his best friend, was acting like he hadn't just showed up suddenly after five years. Like he wasn't returning from a year's long voyage out on the road.

"Luke's playing a show at Duffy's place tonight," Alex said. Marc knew who Luke was, but not Duffy, and he didn't know his "place." When the three of them made their way there, it turned out to be an apartment on Van Horne. It was fortuitously located on an odd corner, next to no-one, on an industrial street. Duffy was committed to the lifestyle. The parties went on late, they were debaucherous, and the apartment itself was a kind of shrine to Dionysus.

They showed up early, before the music started, when it was still possible to be heard. Somehow Marc found himself sitting on the floor in front of the couch where two girls were sat. One had blonde hair and a European French accent; the other was dark, with a wide face and the abrupt movements of a scarecrow. They were discussing films.

"I'm a simple guy. I like to laugh, so I like a Woody Allen movie. My favourites are some of his earliest films, when he had the best balance of slapstick and philosophy."

It was 2015. Woody Allen was not a popular figure, and knowledge of his marriage to his adopted step-daughter was common knowledge, but the depths of his depravity had not yet been reported on by Ronan Farrow and the other documentarians. It was an odd choice to bring him up at a party; the deep alliance to the mainstream being a form of edginess strictly associated with the millennial.

"But my first film, really, the one that opened my eyes up, was *Breathless*. I found it by accident. Bought a copy of the Criterion DVD when I was 14, with money from my part-time job. I had no idea what it was, but I watched it endlessly. That's how I learned what it meant to be cool."

The blonde was named June; she laughed when he said Godard and seemed deeply uninterested in him. The brunette was named Noelle. She seemed more open to what he was saying. About 30 minutes after they left, he could no longer contain himself.

"I'll be back in a bit," he told Alex. The party was just getting beginning to find its rhythm. One band had played in the living room, and the crowd was becoming more and more dense.

Marc ran back home, only about ten minutes away at a normal pace. Vito *woofed* as he opened the door, but wagged his tail when he smelled who it was. On the Facebook event page for the party, he scrolled quickly past the description, which he barely registered as being written in an alien gibberish. He found the list of everyone who had clicked Attending, Maybe, and Not Interested. He kept scrolling through it until he saw her. *Noelle*.

"Hey, I wanted to talk to you more before you left, but it's too late. Maybe we can meet up some time?"

With that, he closed the laptop and walked quickly back to the party. He could hear it from half a block away. There were a few groups of people straggling outside, but since the party was completely anarchic, most people preferred to smoke indoors. A red balloon was tied to the chain-link fence.

***

A few months later, he was leaving her apartment in the morning.

"There's something I need to talk to you about," he said.

"I'll walk with you a bit," she said. 

It was spring now, and most of what they did together was walk around the city. They made it a block, up to the buanderie-cafe on the corner, where they sat on some wooden benches next to a mostly-melted pile of snow.

"I need to tell you that---I want to kiss you, but I'm afraid, I really don't know how you feel about me..."

She kissed him.

"Look," she said, smiling shyly. "I don't really want to be exclusive..."

# 2016: Eden and La plante

A year later, winter come and gone. Snow falling softly as he sat in an alley, sending long text messages to Noelle. She had blocked his number and he wrote because he knew she would not receive them. The MDMA was hitting. He was just across the street from Duffy's place, expropriated by the landlord and the entire building shut down for renovations. Tonight he was going to a show at La Plante, one of the several DIY venues in the neighbourhood.

Radiant Baby performed stood onstage, gyrating his hips, makeup and sequins glowing in the lights. As Marc stood by himself, moving and feeling a profound connection to the kitschy electro-pop, someone tapped him on the shoulder.

"Don't I know you?" she asked.

"Uh..." he looked at her closely, difficult in the dark and with his vision swimming. A vertigo overtook him, but at this point connections still felt possible. The city was still new; everything happened so fast and furiously that he started to take it for granted. This level of socializing was his only frame of reference, so for him it felt normal that a pretty girl would tap him on the shoulder in the dark, at a show in an underground venue, and start talking to him out of her own volition.

"I don't think so," he said.

"Yeah, aren't you taking French lessons? Don't you go to the Centre Saint-Louis?"

"Wow, that's right, I do!" He was more surprised at being recognized than by the rarity of the conversation. Even with his small frame of reference---even feeling like it's normal that a woman would come up and talk to him, the fact of being recognized was not normal. Even now, at 25, in his glory years, he still conceived of himself as being invisible and anonymous.

"Wow! Yes, that's right!" He studied her face again. Curly dark hair down to her ears, high cheekbones and a sharp nose. He liked it.

"I recognized you," she told him.

They chatted as Radiant Baby continued through his set. It turned out that she knew him, which is what brought her to the event that night. She was there with friends.

"Who are you here with?"

"Just myself."

She seemed impressed, revealing the generosity of her spirit. Rather than think *loser with no options*, she thought *intentional decision*. The show was wrapping up and it still wasn't even 1 in the morning.

"Any plans after this?" she asked him. She saved him the responsibility of having to be the one to ask.

"I heard there was a show going on at Brasserie Beaubien, I might go to that," he said. "Want to come check it out?"

"Yeah, that sounds fun," she smiled.

When he opened the door to Brasserie Beaubien, it was still and empty. The bartender was sweeping the floor; she glared at the two of them.

"Oh, well, I guess not," he said. "We could just go across the street to NDQ and get a drink?"

"Okay!" she said, continuing her charitable streak. Luckily he had cash in his pocket. At the end of the night, he got her number. They slept in the same bed together, and he brought himself to kissing her, but couldn't bring himself to have sex. Noelle had texted him the day previously that she had tested positive for chlamydia and he was still waiting on his own test results. It wasn't until a few months into the relationship that she opened up even more. She had been dating the guy from Ought---the frontman of the sensational new band---and he had broken her heart. He was her rebound, but it turned into something more complex. She hadn't expected it.

"You're not basic," she told him.

He had never known anyone to embody the idea of "emotional intelligence" as aptly as she. She had the power to analyze everything, to break it all, to reveal the motivations that were hidden even from himself. He never would have dreamed that his body language was as transparent as she could reveal it to be. Everything became clear as she pulled the wool from his eyes; even his desire to maintain two relationships simultaneously she saw as a symptom of the virtue of loyalty. Loyal to a fault.

It wasn't until their meeting at Cafe Olimpico that she spelled it all out for him.

"If you're in an open relationship...then you can only ever be in relationships with other people in open relationships..." she said. "You aren't increasing your chances, you're limiting them. You're trying to have your cake and eat it, too, by having the fulfillment of a relationship without the constraint of being sexually or emotionally monogamous. But you're really just halving your opportunities."

# 2024: Eric's Last Stand

A bubble appeared from out of the circuit. "John's died," it said. Daniella's chest contracted.

It turned out that he had died a month ago, and his parents were just now beginning to circulate the news. It had only been a month and a half since she last saw him. Just before Christmas. She had visited his small studio in the Mile Ex. The condo was brand new and sparkling clean. It could only have been his parents who paid for it, since he didn't work and his art didn't sell. Just spent all day at home, playing video games between working on his paintings. Sometimes they might meet in a park or pop into a store during the summer, but she rarely saw him in public.

"What have you been up to?" Daniella asked, standing next to the linoleum counter-top. She opened the wood-and-glass cupboard, pulled one of four glasses out and filled it from the Brita filter on the counter-top. Meanwhile, John sat in the plang by the window and put his feet up. Daniella took her place on the futon opposite him and looked at her reflection in the dark surface of the TV. The pale yellow light of a floor lamp in the corner lit up their faces with an aggravating lack of shadows.

"I've been working," he said.

"Working where?"

"Here---I stopped renting the studio. It was just a waste of money, since I have a spare room here anyway. I'm working on a new series based on the representation of the female nude in Hollywood films."

"Oh, that sounds...so much like you." She couldn't help but notice that such a series would not actually require him to interact with any aspect of the feminine that he couldn't reach from home. And of course the series could easily be his best, since he had found a way to tap into a lifetime of organic research.

Now he was dead, and who knows what had happened to his paintings. The message came from Lindsay, who knew his parents and was spreading the word among his friends. John's parents didn't mention the cause of death, but she speculated on the phone.

"It must have been suicide," said the voice in her ears. Daniella was sitting at her desk at work.

"Do you really think he would do that? I spoke to him just a few weeks before he died, he didn't seem suicidal."

"I spoke to him like, two days before he died. He wasn't acting like the Joker or anything, he wasn't being over the top, but when I think back, he just seemed so numb---like he was removed from everything. Like he had given up."

"Maybe you're right," Daniella said as she was scrolling aimlessly through her spreadsheets. Not looking for anything, just moving the mouse while her mind wandered. She had two monitors in front of her: one with her boss's expenses, the other with the company's expenses. It was her job to manage the purchasing and to make sure that each expenditure was documented and brought into the equation.

A few more minutes passed before she said goodbye, tapped the phone lying in front of her on the desk, and hung up. She pulled up her messages and texted Eric:

"My friend just died. I need to see you tonight."

She called Marc, but he didn't pick up and she wondered: if she felt numb now, and John had felt numb before he decided to end his life, then did that mean that she was feeling suicidal? Numbness is a sign of something bad. Giving up and shock are close to the same thing.

Hours passed as she sat at her desk, spinning the mouse wheel, occasionally getting up to drink some water or use the bathroom. Eventually she found herself at home, surrounded by her friends. Eric sat on the white leather couch next to her; Ophelia purred behind them. Heather was in the kitchen pouring tea.

"You are the one who wanted to be in an open relationship. You wanted me to meet Yas, so it's okay if you meet her, right?" Eric was saying softly into her ear. Daniella barely heard him. She was still stuck at her desk, scrolling unseeingly, simply moving.

"You're right, it's fine," she said blandly, not understanding what she was saying yes to.

Heather entered, and her eyes immediately narrowed into slits when she saw the two of them there. Her friend, sitting unblinking, staring straight ahead, clearly in shock, while some man she didn't know whispered into her ear. He had the very posture of a wormtongue. 

"Here, take this," she declared forcefully, shoving the hot mug into her friend's hands. She sat next to her, using the weight of her body to move Daniella's centre of gravity in her direction, away from Eric. They made eye contact, and after a few minutes it seemed like Daniella was pulling out of it.

"Hey," she said, a smile moving her cheeks.

An hour later, there was a knock at the door. Eric jumped up. By that time, Erika and Jane had joined, and the atmosphere was becoming more festive. Daniella had music playing on the speaker and was holding forth animatedly to her friends. When Eric re-joined them with Melissa, things took another turn, and together with Heather and Jane she retreated into her bedroom.

"What the fuck is going on out there?" Jane asked.

"More of this open relationship bullshit," Heather said, eyes rolling angrily. The two of them were not well-disposed towards their friend's style of choosing relationships, even if they were supportive in her efforts to find love. It wasn't that either of them had particular cause to distrust Eric---sometimes, Heather even felt bad for him: it wasn't his fault, after all; he was just playing along with the terms Daniella set---but she wasn't loyal to him. She thought Daniella ought to lose him once and for all, and then move on to a more healthy and conventional relationship style. But it wasn't for her to say.

"It's fine," Daniella said, fixing her makeup in front of the wardrobe mirror. "I said he could have her over."

"You're fine with your boyfriend making out with some slut, in your apartment, the same day you hear about your friend dying?" Jane said, pulling her head back in from a peek out the door. "Because that's what's happening, girl."

"Really?"

Daniella stuck her head out the door and caught on eyeful of Eric and Melissa, sitting on the couch with their arms wrapped around each other, making out hungrily.

"I mean, what kind of girl even does that?" Erika said, bringing up the obvious.

"I know!" Heather was sitting on the edge of her bed, typing furiously into her phone, appraising her boyfriend of everything that was happening.

# 2024: Trivia Night 2: Superbowl

"Hey, do you want to hang out?"

"What's going on?"

"What are you up to tonight?"

"Working, as usual."

"Marc, call me. SOS."

"I'm at work. I can't go out, I have to get up early to go to work."

***

Charles is telling Marc a story from Edmonton.

"At some point, I remembered that I was just one of five guys this woman kept in her orbit, each one to perform a different function. She called me to drive across town to pick her up one night because I was the reliable one. That was my function. Because that's what women do: they keep men around them, alluring them with small graces of their femininity, all in order to make themselves feel better."

They were sitting on St-Laurent in front of Cafe Bravo. It had been neither of their idea to meet there, but after much back-and-forth with Daniella, Marc had finally arranged a meeting in order to catch up. He invited Charles to join them because he knew that she would not be on time, and he felt like talking. He was wearing a vintage brown wool suit that he had picked up from Chainon earlier that week in anticipation of Audrey's birthday dinner at Salle Climatisee. The ostensible focus of this meeting was to get feedback on his outfit. He, being a millennial, felt that it was too serious, too intentional, and was desperate to find a way to undercut it. At the moment, he wore a floppy patchwork baseball cap and hiking shoes. The highlights in the shoes were orange, which matched both the suit and the cafe. Perhaps it was for that reason that multiple people stopped to take photos of the two of them. Perhaps it was just the spirit of the spring.

Daniella was an hour late, and Charles's story had Marc thinking.

"You know that I used to associate myself with incels---only a few short months ago, in fact. Not subjectively, because I have never identified with any aspect of incel ideology; but rather objectively, in the sense that I felt cut off from the world and incapable of ever forming a bridge with it. I felt like an involuntary celibate. And one part of incel ideology, which is toxic, is that women do take men for granted because they live in abundance; while men often tend towards desperation, because we live in times of scarcity. That is the discourse online, but I am very hesitant to accept that this discourse corresponds to reality. However, insofar as a given subject is conditioned by contemporary modernity, it is easy to see that women are being *conditioned* to take men for granted. And Daniella is someone who has fully given herself to the Contemporary. Like Cipher in *The Matrix*, She's eating the steak, selling out her friends; she asked to be *put back in* the pod. So Daniella has in fact accepted and embraced her conditioning; she absolutely takes men for granted. As long as I've known her, I've tried to be understanding of her character---she's flighty; she can't retain anything about me, anything that I say to her. I've tried to forgive and appreciate her for what she is and not put any undue expectations on her...but as we're sitting here, waiting for her, and she's an hour late, I have to accept that it is not simply that she is ditzy: she does, in fact, take me for granted. And I am not a suitor, not a lover, merely her platonic friend---and we cannot get to a place of mutual respect."
