# Introduction

The Crystal Palace was designed by some rough-hewn engineer in hopsack and a newsboy who elbowed his way to the front of the crowd, and with sweat standing out on his broad forehead, drew up a blueprint using a compass and square. Eiffel began his erection before the Palace was relocated to where it could burn to the ground. The indefinite volume of the two exemplars of modern architecture are unlike the hard outline of the St Lawrence Warehouse, standing abandoned above the viaduct. The naked *telos* of this aesthetic of indefinite volume is a series of electricity towers strung together by thick, buzzing cables. The once-great Sign of the Modern Era has been submerged under two centuries of rising levels of alienation so thick and fluid that they have taken on the viscous quality of ectoplasm. Each citizen hangs suspended in conductive proximity. Electricity travels through a network, each encounter generating a new charge.

Alienation is an aggressively transparent, viscous substance that regulates the yellow bile of the general population. What social relations would we have if not for the warm rooms of polished concrete, succulents, marble table-tops? A nutritive fluid that gives us our daily dose of life force. Alienation seeps through the pores of concrete blocks and human flesh, saturating plate glass and iron beams; it sits in an infra-thin layer on top of our phones; as we dip our fingers in, it crawls up our arm, auto-tuning screams into pleasant melodies.

Certain members of our species have evolved a secret organ that allows them to breathe through the invisible fluid of the parasocial. Indeed, evolution has progressed to the point where, not only have gills come to take over the function of the lungs in some of our most advanced modern subjects, but so too have they grown webbed toes and fingers that allow them to swim along the boulevards and enjoy the sunshine from a park bench. The distance brought on by money, by a screen, or by two worlds in imperfect alignment. The transparency of the medium allures Spirit with possibility; what does it take to break through?

# 2024: Trivia Night 1: Audrey

Work was done, they had all punched out and were changing shoes for boots, pulling on hats and scarves and coats. Luis, who worked on the cold side of the kitchen, asked Marc what he was up to that evening.

"I'm meeting a friend for dinner. I'll just wander around until then."

"Well, I'll wait for Abraham to finish, then we'll smoke a joint, have a few more beers, as we are normally doing."

Luis smiled easily at Marc as he tore on his jacket. Audrey Roy stood between them and put on her things, innocent as Helen. Once, Marc, Abraham and Luis had hung around together after work. They bought a six pack of Coronas and had one out in the alley, smoking one of Luis's huge joints. But the wind was too cold, and it had driven them to take the scenic route across the train tracks back to Marc's apartment. He expected them to hang out again, but the tension around himself and Audrey was too distracting for him to focus on the men. Luis had come to Canada from Cancun, where he had been worked too hard; and before that, from a southern state where he had been poor, and was made to feel like one of the junkies just because he liked to smoke marijuana. All he wanted to do was *take it easy*. He was enjoying his life in Montr√©al and felt well-disposed towards everyone he had met. The boss could be mean, but he was nice enough. Audrey was beautiful and had been nice enough to go out with him once, although she had stepped away with a grimace when he tried to kiss her on the metro. Marc was nice too, even if he seemed pretentious.

Marc looked at Luis from the wrong end of a telescope, even as Luis looked back at him through green-tinted glasses. He felt like he was in a knife fight, but with a combatant who did nothing but feint and smile casually as though he did not see the blade he was tossing from one hand to another. Everything was reduced to a single point: *how can I walk with Audrey those last few blocks?* That crucial moment when each would voluntarily prolong their obligatory time together---when they could be their private selves together, out on the street. He could count on a few more laughs before they parted at her corner.

Instead, he walked alone down Beaubien into a late winter sun low in the sky, shining in his eyes so that the crowds looked like distant silhouettes. Nostalgia was once the aesthetic claim of the millennial, the product of growing up during the irrevocable breakdown of linear time. The young generation grew up in the ruins of history, and consequently developed for themselves a new relation to authenticity. Millennial aesthetics were eclectic, disorganized and overwhelmed. The younger generation made its home in free-fall, its aesthetic unified even if arbitrary. The sun settled below the buildings lining St-Laurent, but the water tower on top of the old brick warehouse was still highlighted against the darkening grey-blue sky.

The door of Pastel Rita scraped against the floor as he entered, a gust of cold air announcing his presence to Leo, who stood pouring a cappuccino on the other side of the dark green bar. The room, filled with girls with bare arms, was only momentarily punctured by the chill Marc carried from outside.

"I'll take a grog, please," Marc said as he shed his coat and sat at the bar.

Leo stared at him without understanding.

"A *what*?"

"A *grog*," he repeated, hitting the final "g." 

"Ohh---a grog. Yes, of course. Sorry, I feel like we never sell those so I'm just not used to hearing it."

"Hey, I sold four today!" the girl sitting at the bar piped up. Her hair was cut short and round, like a monk's, and she was eating a bright pink salad.

The drink was delicious. His phone vibrated. It was Daniella.

*what's up tonight?*

*it's trivia night at Bishop, want to come?*

*i'm down, meet there are at 7?*

*i'll see you there*

After finishing his drink and paying Leo, Marc said good-bye and walked off down Bernard. As he passed by his apartment on the corner of St-Urbain, he stood for a moment to look up at the third floor apartment, the one above his own where the girls lived.

Even after taking a cold plunge and sitting back in the steam room, the thoughts would not stop. Sometimes they took the form of a spiral, where the weight of one pulled down on the others until they circled further and further downwards. Ritual kept him moving. He was afraid of the nothing that came without it. When he wanted to, Marc could release himself from the grip of gravity. His traction on the earth would fade, so that he was unable to walk forward, but could feel himself spinning aimlessly. 

He kept walking, killing time before he was due to meet Daniella at Bishop \& Bagg for trivia night. Down to the mountain---just far enough to breathe in the air of its earthy lawn before turning back up Clark. It had been much colder when he last saw her. He had visited her at home, where she showed him a book that had a tarot reading for each day of the year. As usual with systems of divination, he found it highly persuasive. The occasion of this visit had been to pick up a jacket he had left at a party she had a few weeks prior. The jacket was an expensive down layer, thin and lightweight, designed by the British company Mountain Hardwear for serious hikers. It was an important part of his winter ensemble, and the few weeks it took for him to arrange to meet her to pick it up had been cold weeks.

"Eric tried it on. He said the feathers are a bit flat. He said you should put it in the dryer to fluff it up again."

He passed Chateau Clark and took a moment to think about everyone who had ever lived there. All the friends who join us in the process of our life are our ancestors, and Marc honoured his ancestors through reverence of their memory. Erika, Mitch, Shayna, Rachelle, Owen. Each of them someone he had learned from.

Inside Bishop, he stood by the door and waited for the server to notice him.

"We're in a bit of a transitional period." She spoke to him with familiarity, a foot and a half shorter than he. "Most of the room is reserved, but a lot of these people here are about to leave. I'll have a table for two in a couple minutes."

Marc sat at one of the bars that divided the room in two and waited. Two men sat next to him, also waiting. A group of six got up to leave. The server was joined by the tall, thin bartender wearing suspenders and their round-faced busboy, thick stock who looked fresh off the farm from southern Ontario. The three of them dragged the tables around, bringing them into their basic configuration before quickly cleaning and re-setting each one with water glasses and a QR code.

"You can choose whichever one of those tables," the server told him. He took the one that he had sat at with Eden years ago, next to the window and facing the door. It was 7pm, the hour he had arranged to meet Daniella. He knew there was no chance she would show up on time. He sat there nervously as the pub began to fill up in anticipation of the night's event. He concentrated on not looking around him. Daniella was a valuable friend, but even though she had just texted him that she was on her way, he did not take it for granted that she would actually show up.

But she did show up, only 20 minutes late.

"Here you go! Happy birthday slash Christmas!" She handed him a bag, its contents loosely covered by a single piece of tissue paper.

Inside were three items: a dual-language edition of poems by Pier Paolo Pasolini; a pair of large black insulated mittens; and a cycling cap with the Mountain Hardwear logo. The hat didn't fit---they never did---but it had the same logo and brand-name as the jacket that he had left at her apartment earlier in the winter.

"It's over with Eric," Daniella began. "I have to tell you this crazy story. So he was texting this girl all day while we're together, but then I got a call from Caitlin telling me that our friend John died. He and I were supposed to hang out at my place, but then Caitlin, Jane and MJ came over too. We're all grieving together, and meanwhile, Eric, who barely even acknowledges the fact that I just learned that my friend killed himself, is still texting this girl. He literally asks me if he can invite her over, so I said yeah, sure, of course."

"Why would you say yes?"

"I wanted to see if he would! And he did, and she comes over. So MJ and Caitlin and Jane I are all in my room, and he's just out there making out with her. At one point she comes up to me and asks if it's okay. And I tell her, I'm ethically non-monogamous, Eric and I are in an open relationship. It doesn't bother me. So my boyfriend is making out on the couch the same night that I learned that my friend just died. And later that night, when everyone's gone, we had a huge fight. And now we're broken up."

"Cruel---you're being cruel to him. No man is going to end a relationship. He will always cling to the idea that there is hope. You should take him out back and put a bullet in the back of his head. He's not a keeper. Just end it, start over, and learn from your mistakes. Ethical non-monogamy begins a relationship on unsteady ground. For something casual, maybe it's the right approach---but not if you're after the big score."

At that moment, the music awkwardly broke from background-level classic rock to the first bars of "Small Things." Just a snatch at five times the volume before it dropped back down and the hostess's voice cut through.

"Alright everybody! It's time to get started."

# 2012: Tinder and the Beginning of the End

The boys were hanging out at a condo Oliver Hine's mother was renting on King Street, near Bathurst. Out on the 21st floor balcony, smoking a cigarette, Rob Ravensburg's big belly laughed when Marc, pointing to the forest of condo towers surrounding them, wondered which one Drake lived in.

"Let's listen to this, it's the best song on the new album," Marc said, scrolling through the iPod plugged in to the stereo. He selected the song "The Ride," featuring The Weeknd. Epic and melancholy, Drake's signature sound; not quite a party atmosphere, but he couldn't stop listening.

Back inside, Rob showed them something on his phone. "It's called Tinder. You set up a radius, then it shows you all the people in that radius. All you do is swipe right for like, swipe left for dislike. If you both swipe right on each other, you can message."

"Yeah, I've been using it too," Jesse Feig said, pulling his iPhone out of his jeans pocket with his left hand while the other held his drink.

"I've got to get in on this!" Marc was excited. His phone was plugged into the stereo---except it wasn't a phone, but a product called the iPod Touch. It resembled the iPhone, just more flimsy, and without the PCIe chip that could communicate with satellites. He could use apps like the others, although they did not run as well on his device's weaker CPU, and he needed to be connected to a WiFi network. It only took a few minutes for him to create an account, for his friends to take a few photos, and for them to approve the few selfies he added.

"Okay," Jesse said, once he was ready, "now what I've been doing is just swiping right on everyone. That's the strategy. Swipe right on everybody as fast as you can, and anyone you get a match with who's hot, you message them. If they're ugly, you can just unmatch them. Or meet up and fuck them, your choice."

"No!" Rob exclaimed, "that's a bad strategy! You're going to ruin it for the rest of us. If everyone swipes right on everyone, then women become incentivized to only swipe right on the most elite profiles. It incentivizes them to have a selection bias that will eventually disadvantage the median. Women will become more selective, and we'll get fewer matches. It's basic game theory. It's bad for society to swipe right on everyone. Think about the long-term impacts, not just your immediate satisfaction."

"But it's the best strategy," Jesse insisted. "You get the most matches and it's easiest."

"It's antisocial!"

Meanwhile, Marc, rendered giddy by the novelty of so many girls brought into virtual proximity, and already having received multiple matches, wanted to swipe faster and faster---and in order to speed up the process, he naturally stopped looking at the profiles and simply swiped right on each new photo as it appeared. And the matches kept coming.

"Wow, you must be really hot," Oliver said.

# 2015: Noelle is Non-monogamous

Marc showed up with his backpack over his shoulder and several months' beard on his face. His sneakers were soaked through from the slush outside. Vito barked and wagged his tail, wanting to know who was there.

"It's just me," he said. "Boy, you got big!"

Alex Hine and Emma Boorman were sitting on the couch in the living room under a blanket. It was November and the heating was barely perceptible in the cold. They looked over at him awkwardly. Marc didn't know Emma; Alex, his best friend, was acting like he hadn't just showed up suddenly after five years. Like he wasn't returning from a year's long voyage out on the road.

"There's a show at Duffy's place tonight," Alex said. Duffy and his "place" were both new to him. When the three of them made their way there, it turned out to be an apartment on Van Horne, just to the west of the Warehouse. Duffy's place was auspiciously located on an acutely-angled corner, next to no-one, on a narrow industrial thoroughfare. Duffy had committed the place to the lifestyle. The parties went on late, they were debaucherous, and the apartment itself was a kind of shrine to Dionysus. One room was entirely lined in solver foil, walls and ceiling; the foil was torn and marked in points of easy contact. The bathtub was filled with beer cans and cigarette butts, and the door had been removed in order to make it clear that the room was not private, but was part of the party.

They showed up early, before the music started, when it was still possible to be heard. Marc found himself sitting on the floor in front of the couch where two girls were sat. One had blonde hair and a European French accent; the other was dark, with a wide face and the abrupt movements of a scarecrow. They were discussing films.

"I'm a simple guy. I like to laugh, so I like a Woody Allen movie. My favourites are some of his earliest films, when he had the best balance of slapstick and philosophy."

It was 2015. Knowledge of Woody Allen's marriage to his adopted step-daughter was common knowledge, but the depths of his depravity had not yet been reported by Ronan Farrow and the subsequent documentarians. He was unpopular, but not at the height of his infamy. It was an odd choice to bring him up at a party; the deep alliance to the mainstream being a form of edginess strictly associated with the millennial.

"But my first film, really, the one that opened my eyes up, was *Breathless*. I found it by accident. Bought a copy of the Criterion DVD when I was 14, with money from my part-time job. I had no idea what it was, but I watched it endlessly. That's how I learned what it meant to be cool."

The blonde was named June; she laughed when he said Godard and seemed deeply uninterested in him. The brunette was named Noelle Didierjean. She seemed more open to what he was saying. About 30 minutes after they left, he could no longer contain himself.

"I'll be back in a bit," he told Alex. The party was just getting beginning to find its rhythm. One band had played in the living room, and the crowd was becoming impossibly dense.

Marc ran back home, only about ten minutes away at a normal pace. Vito *woofed* as he opened the door, but wagged his tail when he smelled who it was. On the Facebook event page for the party, he scrolled quickly past the description, which he barely registered as being written in an alien gibberish. He found the list of everyone who had clicked Attending, Maybe, and Not Interested. He kept scrolling through it until he saw her. *Noelle*.

"Hey, I wanted to talk to you more before you left, but it's too late. Maybe we can meet up some time?"

With that, he closed the laptop and walked quickly back to the party. He could hear it from half a block away. There were a few groups of people straggling outside, but most people preferred to smoke indoors. A red balloon was tied to the chain-link fence.

***

A few months later, he was leaving her apartment in the morning.

"There's something I need to talk to you about," he said.

"I'll walk with you a bit," she said. 

It was spring now, and most of what they did together was walk around the city. They made it a block, up to the buanderie-cafe on the corner, where they sat on some wooden benches next to a mostly-melted pile of snow.

"I need to tell you that---I want to kiss you, but I'm afraid, I really don't know how---"

She interrupted him with a kiss.

"Look," she said, smiling shyly. "I'm not really into monogamous relationships...."

# 2016: Eden and La plante

Winter came and went and came around again. Snow was falling softly as he sat in an alley sending long text messages to Noelle. She had blocked his number and he wrote because he knew she would not receive them. The MDMA was hitting. He was only a block away from Duffy's place on Van Horne, although it had since been expropriated by the landlord, the entire building evacuated for renovations. Tonight he was going to a show at La Plante, a loft in the commercial buildings on the north side of the street, bordered to the north by the train tracks.

Radiant Baby stood onstage, gyrating his hips, makeup and sequins glowing in the lights. As Marc stood by himself in the dark crowd, moving and feeling a profound connection to what he knew was kitschy electro-pop, someone tapped him on the shoulder.

"Don't I know you?" she asked.

"Uh..." he looked at her closely, difficult in the dark and with his vision swimming from the drugs. A vertigo overtook him, but at this point connections still felt possible. The city was still new; everything happened so fast and furiously that he almost took it for granted. This level of socializing was his only frame of reference, so for him it felt possible that he could go out alone, without any explicit intentions of socializing, just to be around people---and that a pretty girl could tap him on the shoulder in the dark and start talking to him out of her own volition.

"I don't think so," he said.

"Yeah, aren't you taking French lessons? Don't you go to the Centre Saint-Louis?"

"Wow, that's right, I do!" He was more surprised at being recognized than by the rarity of the conversation. Even with his small frame of reference---even feeling like it's normal that a woman would come up and talk to him, the fact of being recognized was not normal. Even now, at 25, in his glory years, he still conceived of himself as being invisible and anonymous.

"Wow! Yes, that's right!" He studied her face again. Curly dark hair down to her ears, high cheekbones and a sharp nose. He liked it.

"I recognized you," she told him.

They chatted as Radiant Baby continued through his set. It turned out that she knew the artist, which is what brought her to the event that night. She was there with friends.

"Who are you here with?"

"Just myself."

She seemed impressed, revealing the generosity of her spirit. Rather than think *loser with no options*, she interpreted it as an *intentional decision*. The show was wrapping up and it wasn't even 1 in the morning.

"Any plans after this?" she asked him. She saved him the responsibility of having to be the one to ask.

"I heard there was a show going on at Brasserie Beaubien, I might go to that," he said. "Want to come check it out?"

"Yeah, that sounds fun," she smiled.

When he opened the door to Brasserie Beaubien, it was still and empty. The bartender was sweeping the floor; she glared at the two of them.

"Oh, well, I guess not," he said. "We could just go across the street to NDQ and get a drink?"

"Okay!" she said, still charitable. Luckily he had cash in his pocket, enough to pay for a Dark and Stormy. At the end of the night, he got her number. Her name was Eden Glasman. A few nights later, they slept in the same bed together, and he was able to kiss her. Noelle had texted him the day previously that she had tested positive for chlamydia, and he was still waiting on his own test results. Eden didn't seem bothered when he told her. It wasn't until a few months into it that she revealed more of the context around their encounter. She had been dating the guy from Ought---the frontman of a sensational new rock band making international headlines---and he had broken her heart. Marc was Eden's rebound, but it turned into something more complex. She hadn't expected it.

"You're not basic," she told him. It was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him.

He had never known anyone to embody the idea of "emotional intelligence" as aptly as she. She had the power to see through anything, to reveal motivations that became clear to him as she shone a light. He never would have dreamed that his body language was as transparent as she could reveal it to be. Everything became legible as she pulled the wool from his eyes; even his desire to maintain two relationships simultaneously, she saw, generously, as a symptom of the virtue of loyalty. Loyal to a fault.

At Cafe Olimpico, she spelled it all out for him.

"If you're in an open relationship...then you can only ever be in relationships with other people in open relationships..." she said. "You aren't increasing your chances, you're limiting them. You're trying to have your cake and eat it, too, by having the fulfillment of a relationship without the constraint of being sexually or emotionally monogamous. It seems like you're opening yourself up to more possibility, but you're really just reducing your chance of connection to a minority subset of the population. It seems Enlightened to be able to not experience jealousy at the thought of your lover with someone else, but really it's just not committed."

# 2024: Eric's Last Stand

"For our first question, I'm going to hand out a sheet with pictures of houses. You have to identify what movie or show the houses are from."

"Okay, number five is *Breaking Bad* and number seven is *Twilight*. Or is it *Ferris Bueller*?"

"Can't be---that's an 80s movie, and this is millennial-themed trivia. It must be *Twilight*."

"Is it really millennial themed?"

"I don't actually know if it's written on the bill, but everyone here is a millennial; they're playing Blink 182, classic millennial stuff---and every other question has been targeted to us as well."

"Okay, I'm putting *Twilight*."

***

A bubble appeared from out of the circuit. "John's died," it said. Daniella's chest contracted.

It turned out that he had died over a month ago, and his parents were only now beginning to circulate the news. It had only been a month and a half since she last saw him. Just before Christmas. She had visited his small studio apartment in the Mile Ex. The condo was brand new and sparkling clean. It could only have been his parents who paid for it, since he didn't work and his art didn't sell. Just spent all day at home, playing video games between working on his paintings. Sometimes they might meet in a park or pop into a store during the summer, but they rarely saw each other in public.

"What have you been up to?" Daniella asked, standing next to the linoleum counter-top. She opened the wood-and-glass cupboard, pulled one of four glasses out and filled it from the Brita filter on the counter-top. Meanwhile, John sat in the Plang by the window and put his feet up. Daniella took her place on the futon opposite him and looked at her reflection in the dark surface of the TV. The pale yellow light of a floor lamp in the corner lit up their faces with an aggravating lack of shadows.

"I've been working," he said.

"Working where?"

"Here---I stopped renting the studio. It was just a waste of money, since I have a spare room here anyway. I'm working on a new series based on the representation of the female nude in Hollywood films."

"Oh, that sounds...so much like you." She couldn't help thinking to herself that such a series would not actually require him to interact with any aspect of the feminine that he couldn't reach from home. She wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be his most successful work, since it was based on a lifetime of organic research.

Now he was dead, and who knows what had happened to his paintings. The message came from Lindsay, who knew his parents and was spreading the word among his friends. John's parents didn't mention the cause of death, but she speculated on the phone.

"It must have been suicide," said the voice in her ears. Daniella was sitting at her desk at work. Smooth wood, a wireless chiclet-style keyboard and matching wireless mouse, two monitors suspended invisibly in front of her. She didn't know where the computer itself was---could feel something blow air on her legs during the summer when she wore a skirt, but never heard it and never had cause to go looking for it.

"Do you really think he would do that? I spoke to him just a few weeks before he died, he didn't seem suicidal."

"I spoke to him like, two days before he died. He wasn't acting like the Joker or anything, he wasn't being over the top, but when I think back, he just seemed so numb---like he was removed from everything. Like he had given up."

"Maybe you're right," Daniella said. She spun the wheel of her mouse, smoothly scrolling up and down and aimlessly around her spreadsheets. Not looking for anything, just moving the mouse while her mind wandered. The monitor on the left had her boss's expenses, the other had the company's expenses. It was her job to manage the purchasing and to make sure that each expenditure was documented and brought into the equation.

A few more minutes passed before she said goodbye. She tapped the phone lying in front of her to hang up. And now that she was touching it, she pulled up her messages and texted Eric:

"My friend just died. I need to see you tonight."

She called Marc, but he didn't pick up and she wondered: if she felt numb now, and John had felt numb before he decided to end his life, did that mean she was feeling suicidal? Numbness is a sign of something bad. Giving up and shock are close to the same thing.

Hours passed as she sat at her desk, spinning the mouse wheel, occasionally getting up to drink some water or use the bathroom or even to just look out the window, where the sun was already down and she saw nothing but halogen streetlights shining on dirty piles of snow. Then she found herself at home, with her friends all around her. Eric sat on the white leather couch next to her; Ophelia purred behind them. Heather was in the kitchen pouring tea.

"You were wanting to be in an open relationship. You wanted me to meet Yas, so it's okay if you meet her, right?" Eric was speaking quietly into her ear. Daniella barely heard him. She didn't understand why he was speaking so quietly. She was still at her desk, scrolling unseeingly through spreadsheets and data forms.

"You're right, it's fine," she said blandly, not understanding what she was saying yes to.

Heather entered, and her eyes immediately narrowed into slits when she saw the two of them there. Her friend was sat unblinking, staring straight ahead like she had just come back from war, while some man she didn't know was curled up next to her, whispering into her ear. He had the very posture of a wormtongue. 

"Here, take this," she declared forcefully, shoving the hot mug into her friend's hands. She sat next to her, using the weight of her body to move Daniella's centre of gravity in her direction, away from Eric. They made eye contact, and for a moment it seemed like she could see her at the end of a long corridor.

"Hey," she said, a smile moving her cheeks.

An hour or so later, there was a knock at the door. Eric jumped up. By that time, Erika and Jane had joined, and the atmosphere was becoming more festive. Daniella had music playing on the speaker and was holding forth animatedly to her friends. When Eric re-joined them with Melissa, things took another turn, and together with Heather and Jane she retreated into her bedroom.

"What the fuck is going on out there?" Jane asked.

"More of this open relationship bullshit," Heather said, eyes rolling angrily. The two of them were not well-disposed towards their friend's style of building relationships, even if they were supportive in her efforts to find love. It wasn't that either of them had particular cause to distrust Eric---sometimes, Heather even felt bad for him: it wasn't his fault, after all; he was just playing along with the terms Daniella set---but she wasn't loyal to him. She thought Daniella ought to lose him once and for all, and then move on to a more healthy and conventional relationship style. But it wasn't for her to say.

"It's fine," Daniella said, fixing her makeup in front of the wardrobe mirror. "I said he could have her over."

"You're fine with your boyfriend making out with some slut, in your apartment, the same day you hear about your friend dying?" Jane said, pulling her head back in from a peek out the door. "Because that's what's happening, girl."

"Really?"

Daniella stuck her head out the door and caught on eyeful of Eric and Melissa, sitting on the couch with their arms wrapped around each other, faces pressed against each other.

"I mean, what kind of girl even does that?" Erika said, bringing up the obvious.

"I know!" Heather was sitting on the edge of her bed, typing furiously into her phone, appraising her boyfriend of everything that was happening.

# 2024: Trivia Night 2: Superbowl

*"Hey, do you want to hang out?"*

*"What's going on?"*

*"What are you up to tonight?"*

*"Working, as usual."*

*"Marc, call me. SOS."*

*"I'm at work. I can't go out, I have to get up early to go to work."*

***

Charles tells Marc a story from Edmonton.

"At some point, I remembered that I was just one of at least five guys this woman kept in her orbit, each one to perform a different function. She called me to drive across town to pick her up one night because I was the reliable one. That was my function. Because that's what women do: they keep men around them, alluring them with small graces of their femininity, all in order to make themselves feel better."

They were sitting on St-Laurent in front of Cafe Bravo. It had been neither of their idea to meet there, but after much back-and-forth with Daniella, Marc had finally arranged a meeting in order to catch up. He invited Charles to join them because he knew that she would not be on time and he felt like talking. He was wearing a vintage brown wool suit that he had picked up from Chainon earlier that week in anticipation of Audrey's birthday dinner at Salle Climatisee. The ostensible focus of this meeting was to get feedback on his outfit. He, being a millennial, felt that it was too serious, too intentional, and was desperate to find a way to undercut it. At the moment, he wore a floppy patchwork baseball cap and hiking shoes. The highlights in the shoes were orange, which matched both the suit and the cafe. Perhaps it was for that reason that multiple people stopped to take photos of the two of them. Perhaps it was just the Spirit of spring.

Daniella was an hour late, and Charles's story had Marc thinking.

"You know that I used to associate myself with incels---only a few short months ago, in fact. Not subjectively, because I have never identified with any aspect of incel ideology, which is all quite hateful and reactionary. But objectively I felt like an incel, in the sense that I felt cut off from the world and incapable of ever forming a connection with it. I felt like an involuntary celibate. And one part of the incel worldview, a toxic part, is that women take men for granted because they live in abundance; while men often tend towards supplication because we are conditioned to perceive the world in terms of scarcity. That is the framing, and as a framing, it does not actually correspond to external reality. It can certainly correspond to an inner reality. But our internal framings of external reality are conditioned by contemporary modernity, which is sick and twisted and designed to work against our interests. It seems easy enough to say that women are *conditioned* to take men for granted, and that men are conditioned to be spiteful. Daniella is someone who has fully given herself to the Contemporary. Like Cipher in *The Matrix*, she's eating the steak and selling out her friends. She was born before the seismic shift of the internet-age---she's older than us, for God's sake, she remembers it better---and yet she asked to be *put back in* the pod. She's got the gills and she's breathing through the goo of modern alienation. Daniella has in fact accepted and embraced her conditioning; she took Eric for granted, perhaps rightfully so given everything I've learned about him; and she's taking us for granted right now. As long as I've known her, I've tried to be understanding of her character---she's flighty, she can't seem to retain anything that I tell her. I've tried to forgive and appreciate her for what she is and not put any undue expectations on her...but as we're sitting here, waiting for her, and she's an hour late, I have to accept that it is not simply that she is ditzy: she's taking us for granted. And I am not a suitor, not a lover, merely her friend---and we still cannot get to a place of mutual respect."

It hadn't worked out with Audrey. They had spent a beautiful two months together, but in the end she didn't respect him, and he didn't feel respected. They had sat on a stone block on Beaubien, narrow as it was, the spring sun shining in their faces and on the crowds filling the street. He had already told her the week previously that he didn't feel respected by her, and that he accepted it was over between them. Now was her turn to say the same thing, and to assume the position of power. *There are two wolves inside of me.* One is named Pride, the other is named Love. They pull him in opposite directions: one will stand no injury to his self-respect; the other will lay across the tracks behind La plante, flattened like a penny for love. This was his chance: there is no chance of letting go without a fight.
