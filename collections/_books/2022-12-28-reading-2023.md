description: An aspirational reading list for the year of 2023.
abstract: List of books and articles I hope to read in the year 2023. More than anything, the aim of this project is to get more experience with independent and self-guided research, rather than following along with curricula. Separated into fiction and non-fiction; divided by country (couldn't think of a better way); ordered by author birthdate (included to begin correlating my influences' astrological signs). First date is conventional publication date; second date, if included, is the date of a translation or edition I already own, or plan to acquire.

I've crossed a few items off this list, and have read several books that I encountered through happenstance. Best to check out my Goodreads to see what I've actually been reading. At the end of the year, I will change this page to reflect a log of what I actually read during the year. Items not crossed off will be passed on to a list for 2024.
