This essay from the New Institute for Social Research explores the concept of the council, originating out of the “council communist” tendency, which is closely related to communisation. A lot of this essay is given over to a form of “social fiction,” wherein the author tries to imagine how the council, as a relational process, would be the form of complex social organisation in a post-revolutionary future. We enter into the topic via the concept of the “mega-machine,” taken from the Deleuze and Guattari’s book “Anti-Oedipus.” And we spend some time ourselves imagining how a post-revolutionary communist utopia might appear.
