This week’s essay is another intake, this time from Chris Chen. We are discussing race and identity politics. The essay argues that “race” is a process of socio-economic interpellation, in contra-distinction to identity politics which seeks to affirm racial identity. The author develops an anti-racist practise within the materialist framework of value-form theory. Instead of affirming identity, anti-racist practise should seek to abolish race by abolishing the social forces which impose it onto racialized categories of the population.
