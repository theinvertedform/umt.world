After a month of bonus episodes, we are getting into volume 4 of the Endnotes journal, “Unity in Separation.” At the same time, we are sharing some exciting updates to the show and spend some time thinking about the future of this podcast.

The piece we are discussing is just a short editorial introducing the book and re-iterating the critical analysis of capitalism’s death-throes from the previous volume.
