This week we are discussing the riot wave that burned throughout England in 2011. Precipitated by anti-austerity protests and anti-police brutality protests, Endnotes explore the myriad social movements that coalesced in days of protests, arson, property damage, and violence directed toward cops, and toward protesters from the cops. Sound familiar? The parallels to the riot wave that swept the United States this summer are striking, and the predictable of this long, well-researched historical essay is that riot waves of are always the result of an extended historical process. Developing from this, we discuss the historical continuity of tactics employed by insurgentsâ€“as well as repressive tactics employed by the police.
