This is a first in a series of bonus episodes that we will be putting out before diving into volume 4 of the journal. We are reading the essay authored by the Endnotes collective, included in the reader “Communization and its Discontents,” edited by Benjamin Noys and published by AK Press in 2012. The text largely a critical reflection on The Invisible Committee’s book, The Coming Insurrection, which represents a distinct brand of communisation theory. As opposed to Endnotes’s communist communisation, The Invisibile Committee / Tiqqun represent an anarchist-insurrectionist tendency that has not aged nearly as well as Endnotes’s writing.
