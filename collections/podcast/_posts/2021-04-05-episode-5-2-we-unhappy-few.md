We read and discuss the first proper essay in the fifth volume of the Endnotes journal, “The Passions and the Interests.” This essay, “We Unhappy Few,” breaks the fourth wall and reflects on the experience of the Endnotes as a collective. The major innovation in terms of theory is the introduction of Wilfred Bion’s theories of group psychology, which bring in a whole new theoretical palette to the journal’s theorization so far. The essay is long and, surprisingly, quite optimistic.
