Endnotes are back on their journalistic kick, tracing the history and contours of the Ferguson uprising circa 2014. Connecting it to its immediate history of police killings and the social movement that mobilized around them, to the more distant history of the civil rights movement, as well as the material history of the construction of cities like Baltimore and St. Louis. The key theoretical concepts that we focus in on are the “composition problem,” as well as the theory of “surplus populations.”
