Episode 3 of the Footnotes to Endnotes podcast. This episode discusses the history of housing in the United States over the course of the 20th century, and analyzes how the housing market was intimately connected to post-war “New Deal” policies. A major topic in this episode / essay is the requirement of state-managed capital to increase the individual debt load, in order to integrate them into the housing market; as well, the racial dynamics that were at play, as informed by and determinate of the housing market.
