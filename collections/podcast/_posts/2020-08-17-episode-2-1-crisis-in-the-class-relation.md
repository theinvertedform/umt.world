[Owen Gilbride](http://world3.tk) and I have been recording a new podcast, discussing every essay in the Endnotes series. We are beginning with Endnotes no. 2 “Misery and the Value-Form” because I didn’t order no. 1.

The first episode of the podcast is out now. You can add [this URL](https://umt.world/category/footnotes-to-endnotes/feed/) to your podcast apps. You can also [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg9O4cjkUgc) (don’t forget to subscribe). The essay under review can be read [here](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/2/en/endnotes-crisis-in-the-class-relation).

As with everything good, we are doing this for our own edification.

The music in the show is by Owen, a prolific musician–[check out more of his music here](http://world3.tk)–and I am very grateful for his engineering skills.

The thumbnail shows a detail from Hilma af Klimt’s “Altarpiece,” the first in her “Group X” series of paintings. It because it seems to represent the ascension to mystical heights of knowledge that you will undergo by listening and subscribing to this podcast.

If you have any feedback, we are both all ears. Drop me a line on Twitter, or send me an email. Owen is much more difficult to contact.
