This week’s episode of the Footnotes to Endnotes podcast is on the essay “The Moving Contradiction.” The theme continues building the same methodological and theoretical premises the Endnotes collective have been outline over the course of this issue, this time at a much more abstract level. Our verdict is that this essay is “bad,” repetitive, and so we use it instead as a a point of departure for a more free-form conversation about Marxism, communism, the revolution, theory…everything we’ve been discussing in the series so far, but without being beholden to the text.
