    Review: 'A little rom-com that I watched in the background while doing some coding. I liked Ben Stiller''s high-waisted, pleated wool pants, and the oversized shirt tucked into them--very 90s, very cool. I liked Patricia Arquette''s mom look, and Josh Brolin was great. Also really loved the second son of the main character''s parents, in the final section of the movie.'

    Review: 'This film almost said something deep about the nature of love, but in the end didn''t quite manage to say anything meaningful. Maybe I only thought it got close to saying something deep because it was affecting, and made me remember some of those supercharged moments when you meet someone, and I want it to justify itself.'

    Review: "Mission Impossible films are truly about nothing. Pure spectacle, the plots are an echo from the time period of the first film. A cabal of \\"anarchists\\" with no greater motivation than to destroy, and who use a nuclear bomb, no less? It's from another period of history, and is completely devoid of any subtext that makes the film \\"about\\" something more than its plot. \n\nThe chase scenes through Paris were pretty cool, as was the first fight scene in the washroom."

Found it a bit suspicious that the ending causes us to project our feelings of good-will onto the racist police chief, but I saw that coming from the scene in the greenhouse. It''s also a bit fucked that a major plot hook depends on the rape and impregnation of a 16 year old girl, who is depicted as something like a nymphomaniac.'

I really didn't understand this movie; I thought it was extremely bizarre, and when the dude was crying toward the end about his dead octopus (lover?), well, I just felt like it was pretty strange!\n\nI thought the queer theoretical reading on Twitter was a bit arbitrary. Death of the author and all, it's fine, I can see how Sophie derived her reading from the film, and I don't think the extreme backlash is justified--but it does feel somewhat irrelevant to the text itself."

Something in the sound mix was off--I had to struggle to hear the dialogue.\n\nI liked all the more subtle meta aspects of the film, before it got really heavy-handed in the third act. It felt nice and subtle, like Cabin in the Woods but, ~20 years before that film."

    Review: "Very cool structural film, pretty typical Soderbergh experimentation. Layers. I thought it was all pretty subtle and well-crafted, not meta in an annoying way. The moment when the film-within-the-film is revealed as such felt pretty cool and climactic. The keyhole sex scene was simply gorgeous, and there are many other very gorgeous moments in the film.\n\nWhat I will say is that, although the formalism stands the test of time, the actual drama in both this film, and Sex, Lies & Videotape don't quite. The relationships and dynamics explored are a bit typical, and don't entirely hold interest for the entire duration. Something about them is just very classic and identifiable as 90s indie drama."

Great locations and cinematography. Story was extremely boring: felt like there were long stretches where nothing was happening, and the ending was particularly bad. Despite the montage of scenes and images from throughout the film, unless I'm missing something--there was nothing in the story or the content of the film to foreshadow or give any clue to the ending.\n\nPerhaps it's symbolic in some way, and I'll think about it a bit more, but if that's so, the symbolism was insufficiently developed, or there was no cipher given to decode it.\n\nAlso wasn't scary."

    Review: "The party scene remains one of my all-time favourite party scenes in cinema, alongside the rave scene from Spaced.\n\nYou can really see how Paul is written as a gay guy and his character remains essentially that throughout the first 3/4 of the film, until the abrupt shift when he becomes a love interest. Something about his first move doesn't quite sit right with me--if he were straight, and as smooth and nice a guy as he is presented to be, I think it would have done more for their sexual and romantic chemistry if he had played it out a bit longer. He should not have simply kissed her at the end of their day playing together, but rather not kissed her so that she would become perplexed and her desire for him would be supercharged. That's my pickup advice: create extremely romantic situations and a sexually charged atmosphere, but then hold off on actually making a move, which will cause her to begin to thirst, and initiate the process of making a move.\n\nNot only does it increase her desire while preserving your face, but it also makes it so once the desire becomes consummated by the woman, consent is unambiguously given without the need to demystify the encounter by asking for it."

    Review: 'Watching this a few days after the original caused me to realize that all those Ridley Scott additions to the Alien franchise try to play off what made John Carpenter''s film so great. Coming across a bunch of action post-factum, and not having a clear understand of the mystery of it, is an important part of the original film''s power. This one is fine, but those newer Alien movies are really just strip-mining cosmic horror. Attempting to intrigue with mystery, but at the same time completely eradicating all mystery and expositing the story to the most extreme degree possible. '

    Review: "Extremely emotional and \\"soft\\" mob movie. The relationship between Pacino and Depp is really touching, heartfelt, moving, and it's nice how there is not a lot of masculine posturing that separates them. I thought it was a bit difficult to follow the main plot involving the various crime families and whatnot, but there was a yapping puppy rolling on the floor distracting me.\n\nI also thought it was cool how little action there was. Really, this was just a serious, emotional drama in the guise of a mob film. It doesn't really follow the same glorified and gleeful arcs of a lot of other films in this genre, especially from the big S Man himself.\n\nI really liked Depp and his moustache in this film. I felt motivated to read it after reading some thread comparing it to Goodfellas, and saying that it looked like a made-for-TV film. Something about it, in the OP's eyes, looked of a lesser quality. Much of the thread was people talking about how the washed-out and grey colour-grading was a trend in cinema at the time. People are fucking dumbasses, especially on Reddit. This movie looked great, and was a far more serious character study and dramatic narrative, with much more heartfelt performances and intimate moments between character types who are so often cloaked in masculinity, than any Casino or Goodfellas."

    Review: "feels aesthetically like an extended episode of the twilight zone. not in a condescending way, and not only because of the scifi elements of the plot. 50s aesthetics are just so distinct from decades prior; whereas the 40s and downward feel more cognitively distinct as from another historical era--definitely ancient, definitely from a very distant past--the 50s feels close to the contemporary, but it still has that antique edge to it. i'm talking about the production design.\n\nmaybe that has to do with the non-cinematic qualities of this film and the production design (again), including costuming. i feel like, in a lot of 50s films that aren't headed by big stars that we still recognize today, the actors look extremely normal--as though they are non-actors pulled off the street.\n\ni think that this film is just not cinematic in its production design and casting. it's still quite good, though, and very relaxing. i like 50s american genre films because they function as relaxing, low-stakes movies that you can half pay attention to, but the cinematic conventions of the time are still infinitely classier than those of today; and there is not this potential alienation of watching movies from earlier decades, whose antiquity might make them hard to digest for the brain-addled."

    Review: 'insanely good. avengers and other big, ensemble action films that try to juggle a dozen characters should take lessons from this. seems like it would have been great fun / a great challenge to edit this. altman''s camerawork (drifting, moving around) is so damn good, really fits the subject here, and absolutely iconic. really funny, but also lots of extremely dark parts--sometimes both at once. the best example being the shouting match between julianne moore''s character and her husband, where she reveals that she cheated on him at a party three years prior. the dialogue is so good, the performances are all so good--there are real laughs in the middle of this extremely serious, dark, dramatic moment.'

    Review: "This movie lost me during the scene with Jack Nicholson and his long-term GF, when he is shouting at her and she says something to the effect of \\"your abuse is nothing to me, it's a gift.\\" Complete bullshit. The movie is simply not very good, and that scene, the real climax of the film, felt overplayed.\n\nThe best part was the opening section, which made me feel bad in a serious way; the banter between the two bros felt extremely real. After that, it went straight downhill."

    Review: not very good. weirdly, i thought that the idris elba character and the doctor character were reversed: many contemporary films are happy to depict the american military as being unsympathetic and money-hungry. i thought that a contemporary version of this film would have had him want to preserve the two kids in order to make some vaccine and make a bunch of money, while the doctor character would more realistically be interested in clamping down on spread of the virus.

    Review: "really good cinematography. i haven't watched a classic woody in so long; they're actually shocking. truly, they don't make them like they used to--and in a way, i feel like that's a bad thing. filmmaking has just become so institutionalised that there is not even the remote possibility for individual idiosyncrasy.\n\nthe rope wriggling scene in particular is just something that would never get shot today in a million years--it's 100% creepy, unabashedly lascivious. the helium scene was a nice callback to woody's early slapstick. the new york street photography is fucking incredible and worth the price of admission on its own."

    Review: "probably my fourth of fifth viewing of this film. i still love it: the climactic scene in the corridor is certainly the best example of lovecraftian horror i've seen in film. the overall atmosphere is so good, too. carpenter is a very atmospheric filmmaker, but in this one he just does it so well.\n\nit's really unfortunate that it has as many cheesy elements as it does. the kills, the liquid, the characters, some of the acting, some of the writing. The Thing is a much better overall film with the same lovecraftian cosmic horror atmosphere, but its soundtrack and vibe are not quite on par with this. The Thing is too close to something like an action or a conventional monster movie, whereas Prince of Darkness is pretty uncompromisingly cerebral.\n\nthere's some weird stuff going on with the relationship between the two lead actors, and the overall dynamics between men and women in the film. i think it's intentional, there were a few lines of dialogue that made the antagonism between the sexes explicit. i wonder if it's supposed to be another effect of nega-god's encroachment into our world, or if the parallel goes the other way?\n\ni still love this movie, flaws and all."

    Review: "the editing and a few of the pacing choices, especially early on, really threw me off. there are certain elements, like the momentum of the introductory scene (not the pre-credit ode), that suggested the film was meant to be a light-hearted satire. as well, some of the graphic elements of the film. however, the rest of the time, the film was played entirely straight and serious, as an epic surrealist fantasy hero's quest. i personally didn't find that those two qualities mixed particularly well, so the entire thing felt off-balance.\n\nthere were some good sequences, like all of the bits with King Arthur--i really loved that performance. i also found the sex scene to be quite powerful.\n\nthinking back, i'm not entirely sure what the relationship between gawain's mother and the green knight was supposed to be. she summoned this wood-knight to challenge her son so that he could prove himself by rejecting the protection she offered? not a bad theme, and a certain oedipal dynamic does reoccur--as in the callback to his mother during the aforementioned sex scene.\n\non the whole, some decent imagery and cinematography with some decent performances, but the film itself felt off-kilter and unbalanced."

    Review: "At times it felt like this movie was intentionally blunting itself, because if they wrote the speeches coming from the Purgers to be effective, they would be shockingly close to reality.\n\nUltimately the politics of this film are quite anti-proletariat. They are very much a combination of woke identity politics and liberal American capitalist values. The class conflict in the first act of the film is quickly discarded in favour of making the film a race war.\n\nThe Purge films are almost uniformly marred by schlocky filmmaking, but what's really frustrating about the series is that they are intentionally made to represent issues of identity as the primary factor responsible for violence and conflict within the United States, rather than issues of class. With each subsequent piece of the franchise, socioeconomic inequality as the motivating force of the purge is subsumed within the true evil: racial division."

    Review: "Lots going on in this ambitious movie, but it got pretty confusing about midway through when they started revealing Candyman's backstory. It got especially confusing for me at the end, when they started piling themes and imagery on top of each other. It became difficult for me to keep track of the plot / mythology, as well as the themes (I suspect that the gentrification / race theme was, in fact, abandoned). Not sure what the bees were about, not sure what the witch's pyre was about.\n\nSome quite frightening images / sequences, like around the toilet. I never saw this in the 90s, but I certainly remember it. \n\nI love the device of academics as the basis of a horror film. My favourite horror film, Prince of Darkness, is also about academics. Partially because I like the idea of academics getting into adventures, partially because I think it just grounds the film in the empirical, so that fantastical elements become all the more jarring."

    Review: 'I thought Danny Boyle and Greta Gerwig had some of the best points in this film. The first, from Boyle, was that the landscape has changed, and if you can''t change with it then that''s fine but you will be left behind. The second is that society has become so oversaturated with images, that the younger generation are unquestionably experiencing an inferior form of cinematic culture. This is not to say that they are "suffering," as though shittier films is some great tragedy; just that the standard has lowered and everything is uniformly worse. However, to bring it back around to Danny Boyle, the key is to accept that and understand (1) that there will still be artists who arise out of the sea of shit; and (2) represent the old school, fight the dying of the light, and try to find something to pass on from a time when things were marginally better.'

    Review: "really really good, ofc, but i think the very slight problem i have with this and A New Hope is that because they are so tightly scripted, there is no breathing room to let anything sink in. all of the most iconic moments, like han kissing leia for the first time, and when he says \\"i know,\\" all come and go so quickly because the plot is moving along at such a rapid pace. it's difficult for them to sink in, at least on a first viewing.\n\ni really appreciated the snow battle on hoth, though. the design and ambition of it is really breathtaking. the AT-ATs are incredible, and using the speeders to trip them up...just wow."

    Review: ok this one was always my favourite growing up. i think that somehow, by the time i was old enough to operate the VCR on my own, it was the only tape of the original trilogy we had left. i still think it has the best action sequences, and the reveal of the emperor is extremely epic. it also takes more time to breathe. whereas the first two films are constantly moving at 100% top speed. luke is much more grown up (traumatized) in this one. despite all these relative strengths, it is not quite as strong as the previous two films, unfortunately.

    Review: "throughout the entire runtime of this film, i was constantly crunching the numbers, trying to keep my finger on the underlying principles that led lana wachowski to introduce epic soybants into the matrix trilogy. characters only repeat the word \\"mode\\" like 500 times, so i was able to surmise that this film is operating in a different (realistic) mode than the original trilogy, which does seem like a successful starting point for making a new matrix film. incorporating different cinematic modalities into the meta-text of the film was a pretty bold and creative move, possibly the best thing the film has going for it, although it does result in some truly weird disjunctions: i always took it for granted that the world of the original trilogy was a fantasy world, devoid of characters aside from the chosen few (that's what the colour palette is all about, after all); so the fact that there are characters in this film whose turning point occurs after witnessing neo's antics seems to go against the spirit of the original in a way that does not get smoothed over by the complicated layering. this film's thematic puzzle gets me half-way to the point of forgiving the front-loaded, ironic meta-commentary on the film's production, which is typically one of the most cringe and juvenile narrative elements an author has at their disposal; but is the film's puzzlework just a distraction?\n\ndespite all the high-level calculus i was doing while watching---and desperate as i was to uncover the basis upon which the film justifies its use of soybants---the question is whether or not it all works. at the level of enjoyment, for me the film does not work. as unpleasant and jarring as it is to see the morpheus character delivering whedonesque dialogue, i can forgive that specific element because soybants are a cornerstone of contemporary culture, and therefore are a key element of the film's narrative about how the machines are all-consuming liberalism. however---and this might betray my essential lack of regard for what constitutes the bulk of the matrix films, which are big, dumb, spectacular fights---most, if not all of the action in this one felt curiously impactless. i am choosing to believe this is another intentional choice on the part of the artist as further détournement of the matrix legacy. my favourite action sequences in the original were always the ones that combined fighting with a chase or otherwise interesting, dynamic set piece; rather than when the epic power scale of neo and agent smith's rivalry becomes a matter of them trading blows toe-to-toe. the best action sequence in this film, for me, was the opening sequence. \n\nwhether it works at a narrative level is another question. over the two and a half hour runtime, i did become fatigued and at certain points released myself from trying to track what was happening, even on the surface of the long expository scenes. i did not find it as torturous as my gf, who left the room about a third of the way through; and it's not quite so bad as to deserve opprobrium; but whatever thread holds the film together from beginning to end is incredibly thin, possibly designed to only be discernible through re-watching on the HBO Max streaming platform."

    Review: "updated review: here is my sketch of a thesis after thinking about this for some time: this film is an extreme representation of globalized, neoliberal culture, and that is not really a good thing. global culture is reflected in the plot (a multi-lingual theatrical production of a Russian play, which carries cultural references to French and American cinema); it is reflected in the form of the film, whose extreme length and pacing is more in line with a miniseries than a film. television, of course, being the new global form. the setting of hiroshima, which is an iconic japanese location for very different reasons than, say, tokyo, bears international significance for its role in WW2. there is also something about the bland pleasantness of the film, the soundtrack, the lighting, the highly modern architecture and interior locations, that to me is in some way representative of the similar inoffensive, inclusive, agreeable surface that neoliberalism strives to achieve for itself.\n\ni was shocked when the credits rolled. felt like a miniseries."

    Review: "something extremely uncanny going on with this film. the performances, which imo were operating on a similar (less exaggerated) level to Old and The Matrix 4, were weirdly downplayed. the entire dramatic structure of the film, all of the relationships between the three principle characters, were completely affectless and barely registered as real. i think it's because the film was trying to be \\"subversive,\\" which was confirmed for me at the anti-climax of the film: moving characters along conventional narrative arcs, but also trying to downplay it and enhance the alienation. even on a visual level, the lighting was quite bright and flat, combining a lack of stylization with barely-perceptible, subconscious aesthetic choices (mostly seeming to relate to the performances and the narrative). overall the film was very weird and i was watching it was furrowed brow trying to figure out wtf was going on. another confirmation that the film is working on some kind of \\"uncanny\\" register was confirmed when i read that the card counting voiceovers were taken verbatim from a youtube video, lol.\n\nok but that said, the flashback / abu ghraib scenes, whatever the camera effect used, it was absolutely fucking incredible. i've never seen anything like it.

    Review: 'a very complex and layered historical representation of Black culture. i''ll be taking parenting lessons from this. sexuality and masculinity stuck out as a dominant theme, and also run through My Brother''s Wedding. trying to think about this and tina campt''s ideas about a "politics of refusal." also trying to think about the LA Rebellion''s project to develop a new Black aesthetics. central to this film''s contribution was the narrative focus on the representation of a wider community instead of emphasizing an individual narrative.'

    Review: 'did a double feature of this and Killer of Sheep. the most remarkable differences between the two was the use of colour, and the different performance styles. both films follow a quite loose narrative, more interested in representing the social and urban context the characters inhabit than necessarily focusing in on a dramatic scenario or character arcs. but there is a lot more dialogue in this film, and it does follow something resembling a plot. the vignette quality of Killer of Sheep is what allow both films to move beyond the particular and into the general aspects of Black society, but the technique is achieved herein through the shifting perspective. new characters constantly cross paths with the main guy, giving us brief glimpses of the two films'' shared world from new perspectives. i would say that i preferred Killer of Sheep, but this one is quite excellent as well. i think the shifts in style correspond to Burnett''s experimentation in pursuit of a populist expression of the new Black aesthetics of the LA Rebellion.'

    Review: 'is this what romanian cinema is like? really quite strange, but also an appropriate representation of the alienation of the pandemic age. especially in terms of sound, it really brought me back to my experience of (eastern) europe: the constant grinding buzz of shitty diesel motors. on top of that, you have the sound of phones and ringtones and people exclaiming constantly in the mix. combined with the realism and verite quality of the first segments, which are just long scenes of the main character walking around a city, with long shots of the urban landscape and the occasional pedestrian swearing into the camera, i think the film did a pretty good job of blurring the line between fiction and reality---even with the highly stylized structure of the film. last song was really good. other people don''t seem to like it, but i thought this was a quite apt picture of both the alienation and the hostility of modernity. everyone wearing a mask---brilliant. a really good pandemic film.'

    Review: 'it''s crazy how much success one can achieve by pandering to bottom-of-the-barrel, juvenile masculinity. it''s fun to think about what this film from 1999 presages, and how the unquestionably real tendency within modern, alienated man that it depicts cohered into something much more lame than project mayhem (alt right MRA shit). would love to see this movie, but communist. when the narrative gets around to depicting tyler as a figment of the narrator''s imagination, it verges into a deeply sickening male power fantasy resting on an unbelievably immature contrivance...but that gets me back to how much success one can achieve be catering to the stupidest people who walk the earth, stooping to their level and feeding their most unhealthy fantasies. i don''t think fincher et al are stupid (palahniuk might be): the film is clearly a highly calculated, and very well executed commercial endeavour. so much of the dialogue is rendered in the form of perfectly quotable one-liners, the depiction of revolutionary desire is perfectly negated by being essentially apolitical, etc etc. still, after seeing this movie probably in the area of 10 times over my life, it''s still pleasantly slick, although simultaneously sickening, so it gets the heart. the most effective moment for me on this viewing was towards the third act when ed norton tells HBC "tyler isn''t here anymore!"'

    Review: "i love montreal's dollar cinema, i've been going for over 15 years (it was where i'd go to hide out all day when playing hooky). i felt quite distracted by the poor projection for this film, because the photography is quite good: it seemed dark, there were moments when the brightness flickered, and of course the projected image wasn't properly sized for the screen. still love dollar cinema though and go as often as i can (it's in the middle of nowhere).\n\nthe film itself was quite off-putting; i had a hard time following the narrative and getting a handle on the structure. something about the editing and pacing for the first half felt really strange: cold, alienating, no music, relentlessly moving from one scene to the next. the focus of the film moved around a lot, and seemed to settle on the main character arbitrarily. the main dramatic event at the centre of the film seemed to come at a really strange place. i want to say the film was \\"postmodern\\" for the cold and seemingly arbitrary pacing and perspectival focus of the first half, which certainly fits with the arbitrariness and randomness of the main \\"event\\" of the film. like a true tragedy, it strikes at random: \\"the hand of god.\\" the placement of the Main Event in the film really kinda knocked the structure of the film off-kilter for me, but i think the film was intentionally made to be lopsided in order to better reflect the nature of real life tragedy (hence \\"postmodern\\" ?). anyway not giving this the heart because despite some nice titties, i didn't really enjoy the experience overall."

    Review: "masterful layering of themes that are familiar from the other haneke i've seen, the Funny Games diptych. media, violence, colonialism, bourgeois social relations, surveillance, repression, meta-textuality. i don't think i've seen this movie before, but somehow the central act of violence seemed familiar to me, but still extremely shocking. this film doesn't quite break the fourth wall, but it gets really close to it; haneke is the only filmmaker i can think of who incorporates meta-textuality in a way that doesn't come off as incredibly juvenile. i think it has to do with actually incorporating them into a work where they make sense with the themes of the film...and where those themes actually have stakes (having to do with media/subjectivity/colonialism/violence). i'm thinking of Resolution & The Endless, both dogshit movies. this film feels like it has a very clear logic, and the idea is perfectly integrated with the formal techniques used.\n\none scene in particular that stood out to me is the dinner party, where the couple reveal the premise of the film to their friends. the characters' movements are over-micced, so the sound of cutlery etc has as much presence in the mix as the dialogue. a very deliberate move that reminds me of Jeanne Dielman. it's an extremely subtle technique that almost subliminally alienates the audience from identifying with the realism of the scene, which i think is the main objective of this film: to problematize the audience's relationship with media."

    Review: 'i thought this was Personal Shopper and spent the entire film looking for kristen stewart. vincent gallo is a bad actor but has a cool moustache. loved the minimal dialogue, the framing, the seemingly unrelated narrative threads. there was one shot in particular, a close-up of gallo''s eyes with the camera slightly off-centre. as he''s talking, the camera centres so he''s staring down the lens, before shifting back to the left so his eyeline is directed at the other person in the scene. i don''t think i''ve seen anything like that before. really incredible. this movie was fucking horrifying.

    Review: 'watched this in a double feature alongside Bless Their Little Hearts, a film that charles burnett wrote and acted as DOP on. similar to Burnett''s prior two features, this one shared the optimism of its middle-class setting. the greater urban setting of south central LA is downplayed in burnett''s films, especially this one, which is mainly shot in interiors or the grounds of the central location. similar to Killer of Sheep, My Brother''s Wedding, Bless Their Little Hearts, and Daughters of the Dust, all films from the LA Rebellion, the narrative is centred around family, with generational continuity a major theme. this thematic content is one angle taken by the movement for an independent black culture. burnett''s strategy of narrative optimism represents a particular political strategy, a socialist realist move of creating from within the value paradigm whose sign one operates under. burnett''s optimism is all three of his films gliding over any direct reference to the racist alignment of the world against black people, instead depicting characters in their setting, having conflicts around familial dynamics.'

    Review: 'watched this as a double feature, after To Sleep With Anger. this one is directed by another guy from UCLA, and although it was written and shot by burnett, it is an extremely different film. just to get it out of the way right away, this film is dominated by one of the most incredible one-shot performances i have ever seen, must be pretty much an entire reel. it''s a scene with the two leads, a couple, having a big fight in their tiny little kitchen. the movie is beautifully composed, with epic shots of the character walking along train tracks, the urban ruin of early 80s south-central LA, a jazz horn blowing mournfully. as mentioned, the performances from the two leads are virtuosic in a similar way to the composition and editing, making this a much more deliberate "modernist" or auteur film compared to burnett''s. another point of distinction is that this film is decidedly not optimistic---which is not to say that it is entirely negative, or depressing; but it is a film about hardship, and far more explicitly critical of the reality of the current paradigm working to oppress black people. depiction of the conditions of the revolutionary rupture is another strategy to the realization of an independent culture, the other strategy being the "socialist realist" preference for working from within the social ontology one supports. personally i prefer the latter tendency. i still want to follow nietzsche''s advice to not let freedom be defined as the will''s liberation from a yoke, but rather as will''s power to express.'

    Review: "some kind of diary film that i don't know anything about or have much context for. about growing up in nazi germany. it is quite fascinating to put this into conversation with digital cinema: there are some quite interesting formal techniques that i can't really recall seeing in other documentary films: hand-written intertitles and on-screen text looks like it was scratched into the celluloid. these texts are unstable, shifting slightly as each frame moves past the shutter---somewhat in the style of animation. as a visual signifier of moving image technology, the shifting intertitles have something going on around concepts of time and duration. it is not simply that the truth content of the moving image is brought into relation with the truth content of the narrative, a very basic reading about how truth and images are malleable. i think it's more interesting to think about how truthhood is used as an aesthetic element; its malleability is acknowledged, brought to the surface, and used for aesthetic effect. another aspect of the intertitles, which are quite important as they are the filmmaker (the film, a diary) speaking to the viewer, is that they use the third person perspective of literature, another formal element that sorta relates to ideas about the truthfulness of images. there is a lot more in this film that bears deeper consideration: the use of silence; the performance of the image associated with the audio track in the montage; and importantly, the diaristic, first-person perspective of the film itself. i have been quite curious about diary film-making for a while now (idek if this is considered a \\"diary film\\"), but i'm not sure when i will have time to properly begin a survey of it.\n\ni don't give this film the heart because as interesting and unique certain aspects of it are, it does not provoke a single emotional glimmer in me."

    Review: "second viewing of this film. watched in the context of a discussion on institutional theories of art. bowie is hilarious, of course, but walken's performance & scene really stuck out to me as the highlight of the film: asking if basquiat is a \\"primitive expressionist\\" or whether he is exploiting his \\"ghetto\\" origins, referencing his own mythical sleeping in a cardboard box in a park---which the film depicts as a choice---are, for me, some of the more obvious, on-the-nose, and frank questions to ask basquiat.\n\nthe film is really heavy-handed, not subtle at all. the themes are explicitly stated very early on, and repeated frequently by a multitude of different characters. this, as well as the film's overall melodramatic obviousness (all the needle drops!!) are points against it...but it's undeniably a fun watch."

    Review: 'insanely good film noir. seems of apace with Ace in the Hole, Gun Crazy, or Detour. the latter two are low-budget B movies, which is an incredible style that feels like the product of a much more vibrant culture than the comparable tier of films produced today. Ace in the Hole was a much bigger film, of course, by an auteur and with a big star; but they''re all three much more rooted in proletarian reality than most high profile film noir. the classics like Maltese Falcon, Sunset Blvd, Pickup on South Street, In a Lonely Place, etc are all very epic, semi-melodramatic, distinctly hollywood films...but an undercurrent to those films was a much more authentic cinema, hollowed out of all pretension. in a similar manner to the stories and characters depicted in the likes of The Set-Up, these films come out of a working tradition of film practise.'

    Review: "visconti's opulent melodramatic style is perfectly suited to this material. central to both this particular novella, and to the rest of mann's work that i'm familiar with is a close engagement with the details of bourgeois life, which visconti irreverently observes to a point where it becomes satire. i was really caught by the work that his zoom is doing in this film, constantly moving in and out on bogarde sitting in his fancy hotel, in his neat little outfits. the central performance is the real key to what makes this film work: it's a character study, told with extremely minimal dialogue. aschenbach comes across as a perfectly realized little prissy boy via all of bogard's snooty, minuscule little facial expressions. it's a combination of great acting, yes, but also great direction.\n\na lot of aschenbach's backstory as a composer (rather than a writer, as in the novel), and the conversations about art with his buddy, seem to be lifted from elsewhere in mann's corpus & life (particularly, Doctor Faustus). it's interesting to make that connection between the homoeroticism of the film's primary theme, with the autobiographic elements taken from the novella and from mann's work in general. i thought the camera which recurs, and which is present in the foreground of the crucial climactic shot of the film, might be trying to draw some kind of parallel between visconti and mann.

    Review: "burnett's big studio debut that really solidified my understanding of just how masterful a filmmaker he is. this must be one of the best police procedurals i have ever seen. critical, but in a way that is wholly unlike the many, many run-of-the-mill \\"cops are bad\\" films that are made each year. it continues burnett's very unique and particular strategy of critique from within, which i've written about in my reviews of his previous films...but i can't help but be amazed that he was able to transpose his approach into a studio film, into a narrative that addresses issues of systemic racism far more explicitly than any of his previous films, giving a whole new context to his critique. the apparent apoliticism of burnett's oeuvre really comes out when you juxtapose his films with those of his peers: i watched this in a double feature with Bush Mama, which along with Bless Their Little Hearts, is very explicit in its critique of the socio-economic conditions faced by black people in the united states. the conflict in burnett's films is generally the product of inter-personal and inter-generational dynamics (most often revolving around a family unit), rather than about persecution by the police (Bush Mama) or economic inequality (Bless Their Little Hearts). burnett's films take place in a (middle-class) oasis, which is to my mind a very bold and unique approach to creating a \\"new black aesthetics\\" (the stated goal of the LA Rebellion). i compared it to the socialist realist aesthetic of prefiguring the social conditions one wants to see; it definitely reminds me of The Undercommons, where moten & harney talk about an interior / exterior dynamic.\n\nanyway what i wanted to say is that burnett is, kind of amazingly, able to transplant his approach into a studio context; and even in a film that deals more explicitly with the structures of white supremacy (police) than his previous films, he still approaches the subject obliquely and from within. obviously the two main leads, a black man and a white woman, are both sheriffs. outsiders, but nonetheless part of the institution that is being critically represented. both make repeated references to how good a job it is, and how they are motivated primarily by money. neither of them are really committed to the institution, and JJ only becomes committed to exposing its corruption after he becomes complicit in it. all in all, a masterful film."

    Review: "took a while for me to settle into this one. at first i thought it was another student-tier film, because of how low budget a production it was; and because of all the voice-overs. eventually i realized that it has a pretty complex narrative structure; and that it undertakes to represent the main character's psychological state, a fairly difficult task. like Bless Their Little Hearts, and unlike burnett's films, this immediately lets us know exactly where we are (Los Angeles). the thematic focus is on economic inequality and the precariousness of black life subjected to constant violence by the police. Bless Their Little Hearts was mostly about economic inequality, gender, and family/relationship dynamics: as i recall there are only a few references in that film to the possibility of crime, and i can't recall if there is any representation of the police. Bush Mama does revolve around a family, but it is more concerned with police violence (multiple shootings) and imprisonment. also, it is explicitly political in a way that woodberry's film is not: there is a character who talks about demos, the BPP, malcolm X, persecution by the police, etc etc. the main character seems to wander around, trying to process her situation and the various messages she is receiving. the film seems to represent the coming-to-be of a political consciousness.\n\ncharles burnett listed as one of the DOPs. :)"

    Review: absolute bollocks. somehow this guy has made some of the most popular erotic thrillers of all time, yet this movie completely mishandled its tone. i had no idea what was going on, and not at all because of any intentional ambiguity. rather, the movie was just incompetently made!!

    Review: review copied from twitter...it sucked, absolute dogshit, at times its cobbled-together nature made it feel like naive/outisder art, made by someone who has never seen a movie before. i did not enjoy the experience, HOWEVER, it was heartening to see a film that was so utterly transparent. the way the main narrative conflict was very obviously going to be left unresolved, in order to force demand for a sequel; the desperate manner in which it was shoe-horned into a larger franchise narrative project. all in all, the ineptitude of the film was really refreshing. compared to The Batman, which was highly competent but so, so deeply serious; compared to most MCU films, which are not serious, but whose narratives are precision engineered to the most advanced scientific standards. morbius felt really low-stakes, its <2hr runtime another sign of how comparatively relaxed it is, especially wrt something like The Batman (WHY are you being so SERIOUS?!?). more capeshit, still operating within the superhero paradigm, but it just felt blessedly unimportant.

    Review: 'fuller''s relationship to communism is really interesting and ambiguous. in Pickup on South Street, it''s clear enough that his representation of the "communist threat" is intended to be at least parodic, paralleling the US intelligence apparatus. but i was very much not sensitive to that on my first viewing. this film, too, really hits like a slap in the face of anti-communism---i think because it''s a B film, proletarian cinema, devoid of any pretension. but there is still something complex going on in this film, and in fuller''s representation of communism and the US more generally. not to the extent, obviously, that he is "pro-communism." just that he does not have any illusions about the sanctity of american resistance to that supposed threat. really makes you think about the inability of contemporary political discourse to negotiate between being both simultaneously anti-NATO and anti-war.'

    Review: "first, it's real that i / we have all become spoiled by the direct-to-streaming age. i have definitely become more sensitive to sub-par cinematic experiences, which this one definitely was. went on a tuesday for cheaper tickets, but it was only playing in VIP, which means that the theatre is a fucking restaurant with people milling about for the first 20 minutes of the film. there's less seating, so we had to sit off-centre and too close, craning our necks. there are far, far too bright lights to help the waiters bring the people their fucking poutines and whatnot. that all sucked and definitely soured my perception of the film...\n\nit felt a bit overblown to me. the soundtrack would not let up; the dialogue would not let up; the narrative would not let up. introducing oedipal elements into the film, just to continue piling up the themes of epic, tragic destiny...i don't want to slam it for being \\"self-serious\\" because i know that most movies are decidedly not self-serious, to their detriment, but the epicness of the story + all the epicness of form make for an extremely vulnerable film. i really liked The VVitch and The Lighthouse, and appreciated both for their dialogue, but it made more sense in those narrative contexts; plus, the narratives were a lot smaller-scale. gonna just chalk it up to not being on the film's wavelength."

Double Indemnity is all script. the performances are great, but walter''s character is primarily expressed through dialogue. barbara stanwyck as phyllis is expressing a lot more through subtle body language and facial cues than her male counterpart. she needs to, in order to seed her character arc. walter is just the classic noir sucker. anyway, great movie, really well written, incredible performance from the leading lady, the guy is fine; it''s clearly a "prestige" film.'

    Review: "written and directed by one duo, and produced by another (the Russo bros, who made Captain America: Civil War, and Endgame). telling a complicated story is relatively trivial---anyone can do it, it just takes perseverance; and millions of dollars is a good incentive. it does, however, require a greater degree of intelligence and artistry to put together a genuine synthesis of thematic / narrative content, and visual form, which this film does accomplish while also telling a complicated story. i don't mean to be the most pretentious prick around, but it's telling that in this day and age, it takes a duo to pull this sort of thing off. this is basically Endgame, but instead of adapting some comic book bullshit, it was based on the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. \n\nthere are ideas at the heart of this, even if they are not the most complicated versions of those ideas. the experimental cinematic elements are, yes, undeniably pop-flavoured; but they are still successful in establishing a recognizable, popular rhythm (Endgame)---and then bringing it to another level that audiences know a film like Endgame could never rise to. in a jam packed, humongous auditorium, with a crowd hanging on every beat, sequences like the rocks. as well as the constant montages, are have a palpable effect. the film is undeniably successful in presenting its subject matter to a mass audience. again, the level that it rises to might not be as experimental as we might like; it might simplify Nietzsche's sublation of nihilism in order to fit it into the narrative, but the film is deeper and more cinematically experimental than most other films, while also being funny and popular. \n\nminor things that bothered me: they spent way, way too long in that office location. that was annoying. i also thought there could have been more work done to integrate the relationship conflict between yeoh & her husband character, with the primary conflict between yeoh and her daughter character. the resolution of the primary conflict overshadowed that of the secondary conflict to the extent that i'm having trouble recalling just how it was even accomplished. for maximum scriptwriting points, you would have to integrate the two conflicts so that the primary mother/daughter conflict depended on the resolution of the husband/wife conflict."

    Review: "very strong ending. A+ on the ending alone. kinda wish that there was about 30% less exposition (i felt like everything that was happening was very obvious and clearly spelled out, and then there was an entire episode where they just literally said all the plot and themes). i also wish that they had spent at least a little bit of time developing at least some anti- or soft-determinist philosophy. there is so much determinism, and then when the plot hook comes it doesn't feel like there is any precedent established in the very heavily-developed themes of the film...when she's pushing the pen around, c'mon, that was a perfect opportunity.\n\ni will also say, and this is going to sound like a bit of an asshole critique, but the story of a quantum computer that can know all based on data analysis, it's a bit of an obvious story. it's good, it's intriguing, and it's well enough told, but it's a very simple & obvious concept. the ending adds some complexity, though.\n\nthe thing that i liked least about this were the performances, across the board. idk why he thought that pseudo-bressonian affectless (it's not really bressonian, it's not really \\"affectless,\\" it's more like everyone is in a state of shock) was the way to go. this was by far the most annoying part of the whole thing. again, i'm going to sound like a huge prick here, but i wonder if it's because alex garland is less of a filmmaker and more of a writer; and directing actors to perform in that style is more manageable. it's easier to predict the aesthetic effect of a performance if you just clamp it down and limit it as much as possible.\n\nanyway good stuff. cool music. looking forward to seeing Men."

    Review: "It's a bit strange to me that Alex Garland, who started out as a novelist before becoming a scriptwriter before becoming a film director, has created a film that is more successful on a cinematic level than are its narrative and themes. Not only does he have a distinct visual style very much in evidence across works like Ex Machina, Annihilation, and Devs; but he is also working a lot with sound design (especially in Devs), yet another formal element that is distinct from the literary. Is there anything this guy can't do?! A complete aesthete. \n\nThe first act of Men is a very competent psychological suspense/thriller film, with only a few moments of horror that break through the atmosphere. The themes of toxic masculinity are fairly clear through the second act...but eventually, the film tries to make connections between its one-dimensional men and the folk horror elements that recur in abstract montages...but the script does not actually connect these elements in a successful manner. It's not simply a matter of ambiguity: the idea that toxic masculinity is a perpetual cycle springing from some pagan root, and that it reduces all specificity (different men) to the universal (toxic man) is evident enough. Neither is the problem a lack of exposition, like \\"what sort of creature\\" is the Kinnear character. The problem is that these connections are half-assed, and such an interpretation is essentially generous: there is no evident justification for why the pagan elements are included, or why they are relevant to the Buckley character's narrative. \n\nI thought narrative was supposed to be Garland's strong suit?! Practical effects might make him a \\"real\\" \\"film maker,\\" but unfortunately this bonafide comes at the expense of being a real \\"writer.\\" Still gets the heart because I'm being unnecessarily harsh in this review, and it's still a pretty decent movie.\n\nEDIT: I shouldn't be surprised by this, but after skimming the film's \\"reception history\\" (reviews on Letterboxd), it seems like the general interpretation of the film is extremely uncharitable. \\"I'm one of the good ones.\\" I think that the final act makes it clear that Garland is trying to do something more complex than simply virtue signal. I obviously cannot speak to what motivated him to want to do that from the outset, but in my opinion the cycle of wet birth and rebirth that we witness, as well as the recurring Pagan images, are critical of \\"toxic masculinity\\" as well as the counter-masculine discourse. There is a clear connection being made between something primordial within the species, and the male characters present in the film. My point of critique of this film is that it doesn't come together---the double-edged critique really needs to be gleaned---but regardless, I don't think this film lends itself to reductive \\"all men, just not me\\" dismissal."

    Review: 'Very unkind to Sharon Stone''s character. It''s harder for me to critique the men, but Ginger was completely one-dimensional. Her fall from grace was completely shoe-horned in as a matter of narrative convention. Obviously this film is very important when considering the pre-history of The Sopranos, not just for the story of mobsters and whatnot---but for its literary modernism. The competing voice-overs are a key element of the psychological depth and fluid perspective that the film is able to achieve. The runtime is another sign that this film is building a template that would best be realized in the extended format of the television serial.'

    Review: "not only does this film have crazy action, but it also has some really interesting cases of associative montage that i was quite surprised to see in a film of this sort. there's one seen of willem dafoe fucking his gf: the first shot, of only a few seconds, has video grain and a high angle, replicating surveillance video footage. cut to dafoe looking around wildly, paranoid. there's no diegetic source of the surveillance footage: it's a stylistic choice friedkin made that gets us into the character's head.\n\nan interesting combination of friedkin's gritty, neorealist filmmaking style with 80s LA aesthetic. the soundtrack is extremely heavy on the synth bass; the title card is neon green and pink; the credits are in a curly California font. the narrative is extremely, extremely noir, which i adored quite a lot. the ending especially (minus the stinger) sinks the landing so deliciously. incredibly bleak, violent, hopeless, all of which i loved. perhaps most socially critical was the moment between the main guy's partner and his \\"love interest,\\" the informant character, when the partner embraces his fallen position and steps in to keep the cycle of corruption and exploitation going. the performances in this are really, really good. obviously dafoe stands out to me, but the two main cop characters are wonderfully portrayed as well.\n\none thing i will say is that i feel like i am chasing something in the \\"neo-noir\\" genre that is just a bit more complicated, that addresses itself to the genre. it seems like a lot of neo-noir is content to take the conventions of the genre, and bring them to a heightened level that would not have been socially or cinematically possible in the 40s: more sex, violence, gore, action, corruption, drugs, blahblah...i'm chasing the high of The Big Lebowski and Under the Silver Lake. \\"postmodern-noir.\\" this was really good. not much of a thinker, but good action, style, and noir atmosphere."

    Review: "the horror of this film is just australians in their natural habitat. a very effective presentation of mundanity in such a way that there is a constant sense of dis-articulated tension. also love how the main guy's relationship with alcohol changes---by the third day, he's sucking it down like his life depends on it. very strange relationship to women: one line of poetry, and the single lady character leads him off to lay down in the dust.\n\nside note, this is the first movie i watched on my tv with my new (used) yamaha yas-209 soundbar. i previously had a pair of logitech PC speakers that i bought for $30 about 6 years ago, and which were failing to the point of being pretty much unusable. there's some slight tearing on the video, presumably because the pi i use to watch movies is now outputting two hdmi streams. the sound experience is not mind blowing surround sound, but it's really nice to just be able to hear things clearly. this movie is all drunk aussies yammering inarticulately, so in a way, a really good test of the speaker's ability to clearly project sound. a huge upgrade. hoping to get a 4K tv this summer that i can connect the soundbar to directly, which will hopefully resolve the screen tearing & allow me to (finally) get a bluray player and start watching/collecting some physical media."

    Review: "I'm not sure if this is an important aspect of Weerasethakul's films, since theme does seem to have a place of precedence over visuals, but this movie has some of the best night photography I have ever seen. Tropical Malady, shot on what seems like a prosumer video camera, also struck me for the purely visual quality of the image---disregarding shot composition, etc. The pixelated grain of the jungle in that film was such an interesting and beautiful contrast. Uncle Boonmee doesn't have that same video grain (shot in 16mm), but the photography is really gorgeous. The sequence with the catfish stands out; as well, the descent into the caves, when the camera is handheld and the audio track is dominated by the sound of breathing...really cool stuff.\n\nThematically, there is quite a lot of continuity between this film and Tropical Malady, right down to a character basically telling the story of the second half of that film. The credits refer to the film as a \\"primitive project,\\" and there is obviously quite a lot about rural superstition (or more generously, spirituality). There is a sequence early on when one character makes fun of a Laotian character's dialect; another sequence where the titular uncle expresses regret for killing so many communists. In the final act, we move from the rural setting back into the urban, and we have another interesting contrast of the spiritual and the modern in the form of the zen monk's robes, discarded in favour of jeans and Chuck Taylor's. There's something going on about (1) the idiocy of rural folk; (2) modernity; (3) photographic media, including photography, an important part of the plot; and TV, which brings a surprising meta-textual quality to the ending of the film.\n\nWhen I saw Tropical Malady, I had a pretty shallow interpretation that was just about how traditional, folk spirituality is better than modern life, blahblahblah. But there's a political subtext to this film that is a bit more critical."

    Review: "this movie was dogshit and everyone who says otherwise is a stooge. \\"oh the action is so good, it's just innocent fun, the power of cinema blahblah.\\" bro, you are mainlining the ideology of the most evil empire that has ever reigned. this movie is satanic, and if you are able to forget that and enjoy the drum machines and constant golden hour footage then you are just marching along to the imperial drum. \n\ntom cruise is a deeply sinister cultural figure. the mission: impossible franchise can be fun, because the superspy premise is pretty fantastical  and there is blissfully no attempt to develop that character; but seeing him in this film, literally wearing his Sea Org outfit, spouting platitudes stolen from yoda, saluting LRH proxies---it's all deeply creepy. i am as confounded that he is able to pull the wool over so many eyes as when he blew a gasket because some gaffer's mask slipped below their nose back at the beginning of the pandemic. that audio gave me PTSD flashbacks. knowing what goes on inside the church of scientology, it is so clear that his unfazed, unflinching confidence is the result of decades of psychological torture (\\"auditing\\"). imagine the scene in taxi driver where travis holds his fist over the flame to harden himself, except it's people screaming at you for hours straight, inches from your face, and if you flinch you get put back in the hole. this is quite literally the cat-o-nine-tails that tom cruise self-flagellates with; and being such an honoured member of the church, there is no doubt that he has an unlimited supply of new trainees to abuse. he is not a \\"movie star,\\" he is a \\"traumatized, hollowed-out shell of a person.\\" \n\nwhen tom cruise crash lands among the hoi polloi, the film treats him as a martian; when he is seen \\"socializing\\" at a bar, he is on the outside, looking in with his blank and uncanny stare. it's because he is a freak, he is not a human being; if his mind were a landscape, it would be a burnt cinder. tom cruise has never had a \\"normal\\" interaction with anyone in his life. this film's great failing, where Mission: Impossible knows its limits, is in challenging him to play a character with depth (i.e. relationships to others that are not purely hierarchical).\n\nthe real ideological core of this film is less related to the militarism and apolitical conflict at the centre of the narrative: it's the individualism that feeds back into ideas of the amerikkkan dream. everyone has the potential to be a hero: the onus is on the individual to secure the motherland, as well as their own personal liberty. if you are not free, it's your fault; if your country is not secure, it's your fault. and if your country is secure, or if you are free, it is not by the grace of the social fabric, which an individual might presume to share in---no, it is because of some individual hero off somewhere who has single-handedly managed to solve whatever threatened the nation. the real poison of this film is more to do with the extreme individualist themes that saturate every layer of the narrative and its characters, and less so with the fighter jets and the occlusion of political conflict. yes this individualism is present in the story about the military, but as people are so fond of pointing out, this film is also self-reflective about the Top Gun legacy, as well as the status of its star. the cultural side of the ideology of individual exceptionalism is half of the coin, where the other half is the literal war machine: the fighter jets, the bombs, the naval air carriers, etc.\n\nfuck this movie, fuck tom cruise, fuck the united states."

    Review: "Forgot that I had seen this film before, but it all came back to me during the tech-fetishist sequences of John Travolta editing film and audio. It demands a certain suspension of disbelief to accept that a supposedly trashy film production company would have such nice offices and equipment, but it pays off in the same glorification of analogue media that made Antonioni's Blow-up so viscerally engaging. De Palma relies on a hardware aesthetic that matches the film's paranoid political thriller narrative, but he is just as much relying on the cutting edge of horror filmmaking. From the opening sequence, a scene from a slasher film-within-the-film whose first person POV references Halloween (1978)---and whose sorority-set shower kill could be a reference to de Palma's own Carrie (1976)---Blow Out references the changing contemporary state of horror films. De Palma pulls tricks without reservation, bent on innovating on the thriller genre to create something modern; something befitting this era of the American film industry's paradigm shift to the blockbuster model.\n\nBlow Out has one foot in the past of its film noir precedents; but its other, John Travolta-shaped foot is in a Hollywood star-based industry that could nevergo as dark as a film like Farewell My Lovely (1975). Mitchum was a star, too, but from another era. In Blow Out, when the car goes off the bridge, Travolta dives unhesitatingly into the water to save the girl: as a cultural icon, he is too dependent on a sanitized culture industry. Travolta's character start out as an unassuming hero among ordinary people, who becomes disillusioned over the course of the film. The same basic arc plays out in the darkest classic Hollywood films, but the difference is that the arc generally occurs within a social milieu where the standards of heroism and redemption are much lower. The most noir-ish elements of this film are contained in the side plot with the killer; and in the general atmosphere of paranoia surrounding the political elements of the narrative. Explicit political references are not common in your standard film noir, Pickup on South Street not withstanding. I mention this just because I think I saw \\"neo-noir\\" attached to this film, but to me it just feels like a pretty typical-of-the-age conspiracy thriller.\n\nNancy Allen's character was significantly underwritten, and for the first half of the film she felt quite two-dimensional. Ultimately I think the script and the film itself stifle her; but there comes a turning point where I felt like I clued into what she was doing. She is playing a character type from the 40s: not a femme fatale, really, but more like an erstwhile love interest & co-conspirator. She sticks to one note for pretty much the entire film, but she does manage to get a lot of depth out of that one note. Not enough said here, but I can only say that her performance is \\"magnetic\\" despite an annoying script and very stupid direction. I don't know anything about Nancy Allen, but I am naming her 1981's \\"One to Watch.\\""

    Review: "Top notch and under-represented b-noir. Every character in this is memorable and fully drawn-out, with distinctive costumes and a unique personality. An excellent script that is able to make every henchman, villain, and cop a memorable character, even if they only have a few lines. The mise-en-scene helps to quite effectively accentuate the effect of such a varied cast of characters. Not only does everyone get a memorable line and a kooky personality, but they also get interesting outfits! I also, somehow, unexpectedly, found myself quite charmed and invested in the relationship between the heroine and her cop boyfriend. Probably just because Veronica Lake is absolutely smoking hot in this.\n\nThe script is really cool; it kinda made me think of a screwball comedy for its fast-paced barrage of period-specific slangy quips---the obvious comparison being His Girl Friday (1940). One memorable sequence is when Veronica Lake puts her hand on the thigh of the titular gun for hire, played by Alan Ladd, trying to flirt her way out of being held hostage, and he accuses her for trying to make him go soft. Bro, she's trying to make you HARD!!!\n\n(i'm putting this in my noir canon.)"

    Review: "A very arbitrary comparison, made strictly on the basis of seeing them in the same slot at the same cinema a week apart, but I liked this a lot more than Uncle Boonmee. That film is quite challenging; Vive L'Amour is deeply layered and has a very distinct and well-articulated visual style, but it felt easier for me to get a handle on what's going on. The themes and the narrative are just so perfectly unified. The final (two) sequences really brought it all together: the sexual awakening and subsequent experience of intimacy on the part of the two male characters---and the complete absence of intimacy experienced by the female character. She walks alongside a bulldozed mudpit of a park and has a breakdown after her one night stand, and after a movie spent scarfing down food standing up and not talking to anyone. At the same time, the depressed guy who, when he is offered a ride anywhere he wants, chooses to go on a guided tour of a funeral parlour, is able to realize some form of awakening of identity via the female lead and leather jacket guy's heterosexual dynamic. And it all takes place in the liminal space of a squat, where the irresolute nature of the setting allows everyone to realize their identity. It's just a little drama; yes, I understand that it has greater social significance given the production context (and so few producers on this, too)---but I am just a sucker for a tight unity of theme and narrative.\n\nIt's especially remarkable how Ming-liang achieves this unity through such spare means. At parts I was reminded of a Monsieur Hulot film, just because of how funny the film is, yet with barely any dialogue. It's a very funny film and had the salle snorting, but I must admit that I took a bit of perverse pleasure when one scene moved from a comedic set-up to something quite a bit more uncomfortable. Relative to Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003), the only other film I've seen from this guy, Vive L'Amour might as well be The Bourne Identity; despite being significantly more palatable, it's nice to see his directorial style in an early, \\"commercial\\" form, before he settled into a market that is barely even part of the film industry. As I recall, he has begun to market his films to the artworld, rather than the cinema world.\n\nFinal thing to note on this is how jarringly AMERICANIZED the setting is. Blue jeans, leather jackets, Budweiser, Estee Lauder, etc etc. They're speaking Mandarin, but this ain't China."

    Review: "Highly successful, but only really enjoyable if you're into it---and I hope you aren't! The body stuff is quite unpleasant to watch, and is very familiar to us all at this point. I was unpleasantly pleased that he introduced \\"eating\\" as another fucked up thing that he could bring into the duology of pain and eroticism. I found myself confounded most of all by the schmaltzy dialogue. Every scene is an exposition dump, every line might as well begin with \\"As you know....\\" But it's all part of that Cronenberg style; funny to think of how people put Shyamalan's \\"Old\\" on blast for its artificial dialogue, but my countryman manages to dodge the same charge. \n\nThere was a point early on, when the psychoanalytic themes were really piling up, that I thought it might be part of his critique of the type of people/culture he is representing; but it's a style of performance and dialogue that is present throughout all of his films. Crimes of the Future is in direct stylistic continuity with films like Videodrome and Naked Lunch: peak Cronenberg, where he has recognized what his niche is, what people expect from him, and is no longer bothering branching out with outliers like A History of Violence, A Dangerous Method, or Eastern Promises. The movie is highly successful in that its production design, pacing, atmosphere, performance, script, narrative, are all quite well unified and are all obviously the culmination of a long-running sensibility. I feel like I've seen a lot of the props before: it's really in the narrative that this film becomes something new. It's pure sci-fi, with just enough tantalizing hints at an expansive world beyond the plot (references to politics, etc). Not to mention all the plot threads that don't get tied up: I was genuinely surprised when the credits rolled.\n\nThematically I was reminded a lot of Nordau's \\"Degeneration,\\" and similar conservative reactionary thought around the onset of modernity. I'm quite sure that Nordau in particular was explicitly evoked early on as the foundation against which the film was responding. It was remarkable (problematic?) that the one black actor in the film is the one who is critical of the evolutionary \\"degeneration\\" that all the rest of the characters seem to embrace, to varying degrees. Because of course that is the position of the film, and of Cronenberg's entire, half-a-century long exploration of the body horror theme: of course he is critical of a culture where surgery is the new sex; where pain has become a commonplace reaction to alienation from our bodies and souls. But he's in a complicated position, where if he is unequivocally critical of his characters' \\"neo-evolution,\\" then he is basically a Nordauian (i.e. deeply racist) reactionary thinker. Thus, you have a black man cast judgement on everything we are watching. The problem is, that I always have the impression that this entire realm of discourse is a distinctly 20th century phenomenon, and that it does not have the same relevance today that it did when Cronenberg started making his films. He is developing a style and a theme that had greater relevance in the 70s/80s, but which no longer seems to bear entirely on the present. There are certain stylistic innovations, most notably Viggo's outfit, but the core of Cronenberg's whole oeuvre as an artist seems to me to be dated. Still successful despite that."

    Review: "A perfect film, and one that is certainly going in my film noir pantheon. The narrative bears a strong resemblance to Céline's <em>Journey to the End of the Night</em>, following a mysterious, acerbic military deserter as he gets embroiled in a provincial French underworld. This is classic, prototypical film noir, but with a few key differences that distinguish it from the American genre. Befitting the roiling fog of its dockside location, the cinematography is characterized by an extensive range of greys rather than a strong contrast of black and white—a look Orson Welles recognized as more properly suited to the genre's moral ambiguity, and which he used to great effect in <em>Touch of Evil</em> two decades later. Another big distinction is the humour. This film had a packed auditorium laughing consistently; I have no recollection of humour in any American film noir, certainly not from the same period.\n\nA theme central to the film noir genre is the ever-present thread of masculinity, and it is quite interesting to compare and contrast this film's sexuality to its American counterparts. First of all—I could be wrong here—but I doubt that you would get a shot of Lauren Bacall lying naked in bed, post-coitus. You certainly would not get a side character entering the room to comedic effect, with no-one blinking an eye. Nor would you get the main character admitting that his refractory period is up as we dissolve out of him pushing his love interest down onto the bed (...maybe you would actually get something not far from this). Something else that struck me as quite unique is the main guy frankly insisting that he believes all women have a price. It is not so much that American sexuality is more prudential; I also think it's too simplistic to just say that it's the result of the Hays Code (which was, after all, a self-imposed regulation internal to the industry). Censorious policy is itself the symptom of something else. I think that American masculinity / sexuality is simply more coded, more highly regulated by complex rituals and expressions of decency than French sexuality, which is absolutely forthright. This is not to say that the end result is any different, because I don't think it is. Both societies are similarly patriarchal, similarly entrenched in rape culture and ephebophilia, etc etc. Americans are NOT prudes; they are NOT more gentle or respectful towards women when compared to the French: they are simply more coded in their designs. Make of that what you will; it's not for me to cast judgement one way or the other, although the forthrightness of the main guy here does seem less toxic than some of Bogey's more despicable turns. This is all just to say that, in the context of watching this film next to so many American films from around the same time, it provides quite an interesting (and refreshing) contrast."

    Review: 'this has got to be one of the worst shot movies i''ve seen in a long time. 90% of the shots of mitchum are low angle, to the extent that i started to feel like the director was getting off on his star power. it winds up with some hilariously bad framing, where you have a secondary character''s head cut in half by the bottom of the image. there''s some quite annoying camera movement too that stuck out at me. very amateurish by producer-writer-director sheldon reynolds. the climax is deeply sappy, the sets don''t take advantage of the location, the plot is boring...just all around not a good film.'

    Review: "This has got to be one of the most comprehensively French cultural artifacts ever created. From beginning to end, from the most basic formal elements up to the highest level of narrative theme, this film is steeped in French cultural traditions. The opening restoration notes are a perfect microcosm of just how different this film is from Anglo, German, or even Russian cinema of the same period. I've never seen anything like them before: the restorers felt the need to explicitly state that the soft focus and other touches in certain scenes were actually aesthetic decisions on the part of the filmmaker, and are definitely NOT a technical fault of the restoration process. This is just the cherry on top of the cultural milieu the film's narrative is set in, of pantomime and performance in the 19th century. \n\nThe French cinematic tradition comes out of a much longer theatrical tradition than the American, to take an easy counterpart; even as late as 1945, you have epic mega-spectacles like this film, but who make aesthetic decisions that one might mistake for a technical flaw. You would never have a similar proviso in an American counterpart like Gone With the Wind. No restoration would need to excuse itself to the audience because American filmmaking is so rigorously formulaic (not necessarily in a pejorative sense). Films that try to attain this level of cultural touchstone are so deeply concerned with providing an utterly smooth and seamless experience for the viewer, that any outré choices made are going to be very clearly telegraphed as such.\n\nThere's too much to say about this film, but this review is quite late and I just wanted to share this one observation. All week I've been thinking about that very simple note at the beginning of the film, and how outrageous it is."

    Review: 'Pure movie magic. Beast makeup looks great; the special effects are so charming and effective. In keeping with my last review of Les enfants du paradis, a lot of my attention is focused on certain production details clustered right at the beginning of the film: the handwritten credits, in an idiosyncratic and utterly charming cursive; and the brief inclusion of the guy snapping the clapper before Cocteau''s note to the viewer rolls. Obviously that sort of shit is played out---I actually hate breaking the fourth wall more than anyone, possibly because my first screenplay revolved around that device---but it somehow felt completely outrageous to show that French PA, with his cig and his beret (I may be imagining that); and then to roll a note from the director, addressing the viewer, telling them to embrace a bit of childish naivete. A perfect counterpart to the end of the film, with Beauty and the Beast lifted upwards into the rolling smoke. Movie magic!!!'

    Review: 'Stayed late after work on Sunday night drinking sour beer. It was our weekend, so we all went to a colleague''s house nearby. Ended up staying in the park until around 7am, drinking wine, stolen ciders, smoking hash joints. Got wasted to the point where I was insensible. Three of us got breakfast at the Green Spot, 7am on a Monday. Two eggs and bacon. Couldn''t finish my toast. Folger''s coffee never tasted so good. Said goodbye; I remember everything except how I got up Atwater. I must have walked my bike. Things are bad at home, so I slept off to the side of the soccer pitch at McGill for a few hours. Woke up around 10:30am. Wanted to go see a movie, but the earliest screening was 12:30. Biked slowly back to Concordia and went to the VCR. The individual stations were reserved for Fantasia media. I didn''t recognize any of the titles they offered me, so I pulled a few random film noir from the shelves. Got a sausage McMuffin and a coffee from McDonald''s. Fell asleep on the floor before I got to see how the guy got out of his jam, if he co-operated with the cops or stayed loyal to his friends. It wasn''t a good film anyway.'

    Review: "In a scene early on, Claes Bangs, who plays the head curator at a high-profile contemporary art museum, practices a speech in front of a mirror. He stops and restarts, rehearsing the point at which he will pretend to discard his notes and speak from the heart. When we see him deliver this performance to a room full of museum benefactors, we only get a few lines of artspeak before Östlund cuts to the aftermath. Although Elisabeth Moss's character has already challenged him on his gobbledygook, establishing the film's satirical attitude toward the artworld, Bangs's incoherent reference to \\"relational aesthetics\\" is key to the rest of this film. Social relations are an important theme in this film, as when Moss confronts Bangs after their hookup, explicitly referring to the power afforded him by his position at the museum; or when the man with Tourette's keeps interrupting an artist talk with profanity. Rather than acknowledge how one man is inconveniencing everyone else, rendering the event null, members of the audience call for tolerance (an example of the woke mindset before it really caught on). The most obvious example of the theme of \\"social relations\\" is, of course, the constant presence of the homeless. They intrude into the narrative, such as it is, by interjecting themselves into the lives of our characters. They are a constant reminder of the broader social context that all these artworld shenanigans are playing out within, even as the physical geography of the film---hyper-modern Sweden---seems perfectly congruent with that social reality. Even when we visit a 7-Eleven, or a low-income housing block, they are still afflicted by the modern design that is in perfect congruity with the rest of the film's settings.\n\nIn <em>Force Majeure</em> (2014), Östlund's static, spare, and isolating compositions accentuate the alienation felt at the heart of a troubled family dynamic. In <em>The Square</em>, they are a crucial part of this film's successful representation of the artworld. Architecture and compositions are used to accentuate characters' relationships through the physical environment. Often we don't see the critical piece of action, or a key character. What I really came to appreciate about Östlund's compositions, however, is his editing: sequences are often cut short, and we are filled in at a later point on the details of what happened. There's a very careful and tightly co-ordinated integration of script, shot composition, and performance that make this possibly the best narrative film representing the artworld that I have ever seen."

    Review: 'Starts off exposition heavy, but it''s balanced well by the comic book-y tone. Once the Swede shows up and the movie kicks off, it becomes quite fun. I appreciated the minimal violence, and the depth of the primary antagonist. Sterling Hayden gives a fun performance as George Hansen, but I feel like there was something a bit amiss with his character. He walks through the movie insisting on his right, but there is no revelation that justifies his confidence. I liked that he doesn''t really do anything particularly badass until the end of the movie, but I feel like he should have had more action scenes so that we could at least see him as some kind of martial master. The film leans into the trope of Europeans as cultured and refined as the basis for an interesting minimalist aesthetic; for the most part, narrative exposition and characters are balanced and complement the tone of the film. The reliance on highly artificial, story book narrative elements makes the movie feel somewhat inconsequential, as fun as it is.'

    Review: "This film is easily recognizable visually as a streaming feature, sad to say, because I am a fan of the Predator franchise. Despite having more CGI animals than a Bollywood production set at the zoo, the film brings it in some cool directions. A period Predator film was only a matter of time, and I hope we get more, in particular a pirate one.\n\nMost important thing about the movie is the new direction it takes the predator. This member of the species is more horrifying than the predator has been in a long time (at one point, it bathes in blood). The monster killing animals seems like an extremely lame thing for it to do, but I think it was important narratively to demonstrate that this is the \\"first\\" predator (didn't know there was bigger game, in the form of humans). It also helps establish the alien as unreasonably vicious in its battles with wolves and bears, which it must know are completely outmatched. This senseless viciousness is key to the idea of the predator as a monster, a cinematic genre element that has been somewhat lost since (maybe) the original."

    Review: "Fake noir that completely misses the point. Set among the criminal underworld, yes, but inadvertently valorizes its deplorable characters by presenting them as noble heroes. The male lead, played by Robert Taylor as an aristocratic, genteel dandy, is also an unrepentant lawyer to the mob. Not only does his virtuous behaviour toward Cyd Charisse, the titular party girl, provoke our desire to identify with what are very simply the socially correct moral values of 50s America---but the narrative arc of his disability provokes our sympathy. The correlation this film makes between its social milieu and the admirable traits Taylor embodies misses the point of what film noir is intended to do. The best noir features characters who are trapped by their circumstances; who are in some way likeable, but who are driven to anti-social behaviour by the set of social institutions that confine them. \n\nThis film is going on my list of \\"Fake Noir.\\""
