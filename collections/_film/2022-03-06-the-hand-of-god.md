i love montreal's dollar cinema, i've been going for over 15 years (it was where i'd go to hide out all day when playing hooky). i felt quite distracted by the poor projection for this film, because the photography is quite good: it seemed dark, there were moments when the brightness flickered, and of course the projected image wasn't properly sized for the screen. still love dollar cinema though and go as often as i can (it's in the middle of nowhere).

the film itself was quite off-putting; i had a hard time following the narrative and getting a handle on the structure. something about the editing and pacing for the first half felt really strange: cold, alienating, no music, relentlessly moving from one scene to the next. the focus of the film moved around a lot, and seemed to settle on the main character arbitrarily. the main dramatic event at the centre of the film seemed to come at a really strange place. i want to say the film was "postmodern" for the cold and seemingly arbitrary pacing and perspectival focus of the first half, which certainly fits with the arbitrariness and randomness of the main "event" of the film. like a true tragedy, it strikes at random: "the hand of god." the placement of the Main Event in the film really kinda knocked the structure of the film off-kilter for me, but i think the film was intentionally made to be lopsided in order to better reflect the nature of real life tragedy (hence "postmodern" ?). anyway not giving this the heart because despite some nice titties, i didn't really enjoy the experience overall.
