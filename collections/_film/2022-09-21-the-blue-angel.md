watched the english version by accident. it's very gratifying to watch a film from this period that doesn't infantilize or try to whitewash its own social conditions. there is a little bit of that in the ambiguity around lola's profession, her relationship to the strongman, etc; but it's far more honest and gives us a more valuable access to the period than the intentional fantasies of hollywood productions.
