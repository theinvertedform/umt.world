robert altman's style must be one of the most dated filmmaking styles that exist---at least in the american canon. dated in the sense that it is completely add odds with the contemporary visual paradigm. i guess it makes sense that he is sometimes seen as a precursor to slow cinema.

imagine taking a zoomer, breaking the smartphone out of their grip, strapping them into the clockwork orange chair, and forcing them to watch altman films until they grow an attention span.
