possibly a bad rip, but the colours looked like crap. very creative filmmaking with some very cool shots. the whole sequence in the field with the mine, the meet-cute, was very well done. a lot of the action and the premise are quite ridiculous and absurd, a characteristic I associate with Korean cinema...but as I recall, park leans into the violence and realism in his following few films. they're more disturbing, less goofy.
