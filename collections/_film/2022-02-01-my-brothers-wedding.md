did a double feature of this and Killer of Sheep. the most remarkable differences between the two was the use of colour, and the different performance styles. both films follow a quite loose narrative, more interested in representing the social and urban context the characters inhabit than necessarily focusing in on a dramatic scenario or character arcs. but there is a lot more dialogue in this film, and it does follow something resembling a plot. the vignette quality of Killer of Sheep is what allow both films to move beyond the particular and into the general aspects of Black society, but the technique is achieved herein through the shifting perspective. new characters constantly cross paths with the main guy, giving us brief glimpses of the two films' shared world from new perspectives. i would say that i preferred Killer of Sheep, but this one is quite excellent as well. i think the shifts in style correspond to Burnett's experimentation in pursuit of a populist expression of the new Black aesthetics of the LA Rebellion.
