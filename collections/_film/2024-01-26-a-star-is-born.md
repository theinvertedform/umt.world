definitely not as good as the '76 version. that version, because of the style of filmmaking, carries an authentic charge. of course it's a big budget movie, but the quality of the image, the performances, and especially the sound mixing, make it all feel like a gonzo indie film. the 2018 version is just a typical movie. lady gaga, however, is at least as good as barbra. she was a great choice because, like her predecessor, she also looks kinda weird.

one thing i learned about romance from both films is that the masculine must seize the moment of spontaneity. it is their role to shove the girl in the car, lol, even when she's saying no, no. it's the role of the masculine to persist !! kris was more of a genuine masculine type for being a pushy fucker. bradley, of course, could never go that far. woke !!
