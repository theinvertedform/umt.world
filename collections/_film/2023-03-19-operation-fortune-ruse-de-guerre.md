this is one of the most incoherent piece of crap i have seen in a long time. at once a Disneyified espionage caper; a John Wick-style over-the-top action movie, but where guy does not have the comic book sensibility and the violence comes off as inappropriately brutal; combined with MCU-style soybants and god knows what else. unbelievably tossed off, feels like it was made in a week.
