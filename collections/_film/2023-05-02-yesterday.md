it's true that this movie has one fairly serious flaw at the level of script, which is that the tension between the two leads makes absolutely no sense. there is really nothing keeping them apart. my interpretation is that himesh patel is playing a character like ryan gosling in drive: he's "special," he's a "real human bean."

other than that, the film is perfect. danny boyle doing a rom-com, my [favourite genre aside from zombie horror](https://letterboxd.com/theinvertedform/list/danny-boyle-ranked/). i like how peter jackson and danny boyle both made big Beatles projects. as a powerful filmmaker, it must be tempting to build castles on top of castles.

the moscow show where he plays Back in the USSR is my favourite sequence. that, and the montage where he is just standing in front of giant screens with arrows and numbers going up, up, up. incredible visualisations of the internet. i was laughing my ass off / crying throughout this entire film. the performances are incredible. such a sweet film, i love it a lot.
