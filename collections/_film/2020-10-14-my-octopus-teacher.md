Lots of gross imagery. The seal pups and otters at the end were a relief from all the freaky bugs. I really didn't understand this movie; I thought it was extremely bizarre, and when the dude was crying toward the end about his dead octopus (lover?), well, I just felt like it was pretty strange!

I thought the queer theoretical reading on Twitter was a bit arbitrary. Death of the author and all, it's fine, I can see how Sophie derived her reading from the film, and I don't think the extreme backlash is justified--but it does feel somewhat irrelevant to the text itself.
