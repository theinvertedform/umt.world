one of the films that tests my binary rating system. there's lots to enjoy here, especially in the first half before it gets so repetitive; and I think the general premise of doing a Kafkaesque psychanalysis of your people by way of yourself is quite admirable & ambitious. the production of this was in general great; it looked expensive, and I feel like I learned more about aster's personal tastes than in any of his previous films (his choice of music is especially interesting: tasteless, and very well calibrated)...but the film is an overlong slog, I did not enjoy the experience, and I have no interest in re-watching (unlike Midsommar).
