I thought Danny Boyle and Greta Gerwig had some of the best points in this film. The first, from Boyle, was that the landscape has changed, and if you can't change with it then that's fine but you will be left behind. The second is that society has become so oversaturated with images, that the younger generation are unquestionably experiencing an inferior form of cinematic culture. This is not to say that they are "suffering," as though shittier films is some great tragedy; just that the standard has lowered and everything is uniformly worse. However, to bring it back around to Danny Boyle, the key is to accept that and understand (1) that there will still be artists who arise out of the sea of shit; and (2) represent the old school, fight the dying of the light, and try to find something to pass on from a time when things were marginally better.
