perhaps a bit too explicit with the lore, dispelling some of the mystique, but overall enjoyable. i really appreciated how much of the production design and costumes seemed to be influenced by clive's classic 90s aesthetic. could have done with just a bit more to close the boundaries between the sex, which was present, and the torture. if anything needs to be explicit, it's that you're supposed to be cumming even as you're being flayed alive. alludes to that a bit in the end, which i thought was fucking great. one thing about making the cenobites and the whole mythology more explicit (i watched like 5 of the original series, and have no idea wtf it was supposed to be about), is that it becomes a bit confusing whether they are aliens or demons.
