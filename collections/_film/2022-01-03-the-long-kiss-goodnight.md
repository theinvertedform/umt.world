why do people think shane black is a good writer. every film he's written hinges around some standard, but admittedly complicated plot relative to hollywood standards; but they all devolve into the same schlock in the third act. it's so boring. loved the 90s production design in this. i thought geena davis was gena rowlands before going in.
