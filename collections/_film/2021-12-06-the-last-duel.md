surprised ol' ridley couldn't get the millenials to look up from their phones for this one, considering how thick he lays it on. about as subtle as a brick. rashomon for people who are borderline illiterate, which really does not bode well for the avocado toast generation(s) who are evidently to blame for its failure at the box office. still a sumptuous picture. "pure kino."
