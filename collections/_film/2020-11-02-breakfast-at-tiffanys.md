The party scene remains one of my all-time favourite party scenes in cinema, alongside the rave scene from Spaced.

You can really see how Paul is written as a gay guy and his character remains essentially that throughout the first 3/4 of the film, until the abrupt shift when he becomes a love interest. Something about his first move doesn't quite sit right with me--if he were straight, and as smooth and nice a guy as he is presented to be, I think it would have done more for their sexual and romantic chemistry if he had played it out a bit longer. He should not have simply kissed her at the end of their day playing together, but rather not kissed her so that she would become perplexed and her desire for him would be supercharged. That's my pickup advice: create extremely romantic situations and a sexually charged atmosphere, but then hold off on actually making a move, which will cause her to begin to thirst, and initiate the process of making a move.

Not only does it increase her desire while preserving your face, but it also makes it so once the desire becomes consummated by the woman, consent is unambiguously given without the need to demystify the encounter by asking for it.
