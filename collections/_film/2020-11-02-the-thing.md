Watching this a few days after the original caused me to realize that all those Ridley Scott additions to the Alien franchise try to play off what made John Carpenter's film so great. Coming across a bunch of action post-factum, and not having a clear understand of the mystery of it, is an important part of the original film's power. This one is fine, but those newer Alien movies are really just strip-mining cosmic horror. Attempting to intrigue with mystery, but at the same time completely eradicating all mystery and expositing the story to the most extreme degree possible.
