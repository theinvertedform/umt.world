this is a very cool film noir that follows a femme fatale, which is unusual for the genre; but it does so while retaining her opacity. that makes it true to the film noir principle of representing seediness without compromise. Bridget/Wendy is cool throughout the whole film, and by the end we are completely unmoored from any notion that we could trust her. by not having any significant moments where she reveals vulnerability, she remains closed to us, which is true of the femme fatale archetype. the femme fatale is an antagonist not through direct confrontation, but through betrayal. we leave the femme fatale in this film with a grudging respect. she is a true villainess.
