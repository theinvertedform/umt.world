pretty unremarkable, but still useful for giving a nice coherent picture of the movement. burnett was the most prolific of them all; fanaka's films were marketed as blaxploitation, and he was supposedly the most successful of the movement (he's also the director least represented at the concordia visual collections repository). arthur jafa has less than one minute of screen time (he wasn't really a part of the movement, just worked as DOP on Daughters of the Dust) but he still manages to come across as extremely intelligent.
