this is such a good movie. the franchise goes downhill once they "figure things out" in 4 and establish the running continuity. this, 2 Fast, and Tokyo Drift are the best of the series. the first two in particular have an amazing, beautiful anime aesthetic. this one in particular has beautifully pure performances from the cast, too. it's young, it's fresh, it's vital...it's honestly touching. in later films when they have montages from the series that include clips from this one, it cuts through like it's from another world.
