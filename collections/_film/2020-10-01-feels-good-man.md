A sequel to TFW No GF, but from the perspective of the opposite side---the normie Matt Furie, who gets drawn into incel-land. Tries to get philosophical when one of the guests begins talking about "meme magic," and explains a bit of the cosmology of Kek. Many of the guests have pedigree, at least compared to the guests from TFW No GF.

The problem is that the explorations are not satisfyingly deep, and a narrative is imposed with a somewhat heavy hand on the documentary material. Additionally, the film lacks a satisfying conclusion to the character arc. The open-endedness of the future of Pepe was a strong aspect of the film, but the cast of characters is not as interesting to me as those in TFW No GF.
