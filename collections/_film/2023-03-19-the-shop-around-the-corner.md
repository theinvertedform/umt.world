crazy that even 80 years ago, romance was still mediated by what amounts to a proto-dating app. the cafe scene is one of the most devastating, savage scenes in any romance film, period. this film is timeless because it hooks into two essential aspects of capitalist alienation: working for the man, and the loneliness endemic to modern individualization. this film is very much about capitalism, very much about modernity. i love it. it's so, so funny. it made me realize that "the lubitsch touch" refers to the graceful, deft lightness of movement in his films. this film is effervescent, lighter than air; but profound, deep as the earth. might knock Design for Living off as my favourite lubitsch (probably not).
