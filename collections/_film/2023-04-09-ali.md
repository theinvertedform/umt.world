this has got to be the best digital photography in any film. super cool pacing on this film, especially in the first 30 minutes or so. there were a few moments where the classic michael mann atmospheric pacing veered slightly into music video territory, but still a tremendous film overall. i found the cinematography in this to be truly astonishing.
