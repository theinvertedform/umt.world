first act is really really fun and silly, but it gets bogged down with long exposition scenes and a slightly confusing flashback. heavy LOTR influence. watched this with some friends and had a great time. the fight choreography was not as good as we get here in the west, sad to say. CGI looked good in places but was mostly noticeable. as fun as it was at parts, i don't care enough about the story or the form of it to watch pt. 2.
