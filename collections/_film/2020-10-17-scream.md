Surprisingly well written. Really the direction was the weak link with this movie, as well as the editing. Something in the sound mix was off--I had to struggle to hear the dialogue.

I liked all the more subtle meta aspects of the film, before it got really heavy-handed in the third act. It felt nice and subtle, like Cabin in the Woods but, ~20 years before that film.
