read about this in the introduction to Film Blackness by Michael Boyce Gillespie. some extremely powerful performances in this movie, with some real standout scenes. some of my favourites include when the mother tries to sell larry her kid; the game of bloody knuckles between jeff goldblum and his character's boss; and of course, the confrontation between larry and the "reverend" towards the end was incredible. a great, extremely dark neo-noir. i quite enjoyed the VO as a reference to the genre, but there were a few moments when i felt like it went too far and diffused tension by signalling what was going to happen. the direction was also slightly chaotic, with the plot hard to follow at times and some scenes feeling like they were barely contained.
