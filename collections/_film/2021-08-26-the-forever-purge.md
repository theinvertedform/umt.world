At times it felt like this movie was intentionally blunting itself, because if they wrote the speeches coming from the Purgers to be effective, they would be shockingly close to reality.

Ultimately the politics of this film are quite anti-proletariat. They are very much a combination of woke identity politics and liberal American capitalist values. The class conflict in the first act of the film is quickly discarded in favour of making the film a race war.

The Purge films are almost uniformly marred by schlocky filmmaking, but what's really frustrating about the series is that they are intentionally made to represent issues of identity as the primary factor responsible for violence and conflict within the United States, rather than issues of class. With each subsequent piece of the franchise, socioeconomic inequality as the motivating force of the purge is subsumed within the true evil: racial division.
