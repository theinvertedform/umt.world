i like when a script has just a slight edge of inconsistency, where beats are lumped together in a crude semblance of cause and effects for the sake of narrative convenience. a glance is enough for one young man to latch on a young woman. she latches onto another young man, the sight of him in a big city bar enough to set off her opportunism. these plot contrivances may be artificial, but they are by no means unrealistic. a glance does cause people to latch on to others as their saviour, or their next mark. the crudeness of the script brings the artificiality up to the surface. it becomes an aesthetic feature of the work. in the end, it's that slight edge of inconsistency that reminds us of the arbitrary nature of all social relations.
