Phenomenal editing, sound design, production design, and mise-en-scene; really nice looking actors wearing nice costumes in a beautiful, run-down Venice. Great locations and cinematography. Story was extremely boring: felt like there were long stretches where nothing was happening, and the ending was particularly bad. Despite the montage of scenes and images from throughout the film, unless I'm missing something--there was nothing in the story or the content of the film to foreshadow or give any clue to the ending.

Perhaps it's symbolic in some way, and I'll think about it a bit more, but if that's so, the symbolism was insufficiently developed, or there was no cipher given to decode it.

Also wasn't scary.
