it's insane how drastic the difference in quality between this and the two preceding episodes. basically from the first shot, the dissolve of a constellation into a rock face, it is eminently clear that this is a real piece of film-making. then, moving into the scene in the office between the coroner and the sheriffe---it's like, a real movie. real characters. something to hold onto, something to care about. the autopsy sequence is incredibly atmospheric and genuinely creepy. some of the shots, i.e. cutting open the heart, had me cringing!! the non-linear narrative structure isn't groundbreaking by any means, but it's at least cool and well done. i was also really impressed by the way the main antagonist spoke!! he has such a distinct voice (in terms of dialogue, speech patterns and whatnot) that i feel like most films in this area (no spoilers) don't really go for...it's all unknowability and big scary monsters. this was great, really well done.
