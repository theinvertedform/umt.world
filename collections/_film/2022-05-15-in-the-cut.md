watching this the same day after The Lost City (2022) was a very strange experience. two very different representations of heterosexuality: the one geared for a population of coddled grown-up children, who still, after a century, want the reassurance of a hollywood ending...versus this, which is a very complicated and intimate psychological exploration. really loved the camerawork, and how it + the editing came together to represent the heroine's psychological state---some truly excellent editing, especially in the BJ scene, or the scene where she first meets mark ruffalo. the sex scenes were incredible of course: loved the ruffalo character's combination of pussy-whispering savvy with complete chud behaviour...the scene at the bar, where he turns his back to meg ryan. wow! great movie. complicated. definitely for grown ups. don't know if i'm supposed to find the sex scenes hot, but they were quite excellent.
