moving, hilarious. mads must be one of the best looking men out there. the representation of denmark was really interesting: it seems like a beautiful, idyllic place where school teachers can afford nice homes with nice hifi sound systems; but also, the entire country "drink like maniacs." the production design of the school was quite interesting, as well: it felt like a lived-in, organic space, as opposed to the highly sterile, institutionalized school environments of north america. i liked how the kids all seemed to be real human beings with their own unique personalities and personal styles---again, a big contrast to how teenagers both are and are represented in an american context.

i will say that i did not like the hollywood schmaltzy happy ending. the literal ending, with the dancing, was incredible; but the conclusion to the main character's narrative was lame af. not very kierkegaardian, mr. vinterberg!
