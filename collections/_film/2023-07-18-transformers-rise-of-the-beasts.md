call me crazy but i thought this was pretty good. far better characterization than typical in shitty movies, especially on the female lead, who pulled off weird autistic behaviours in a way that i haven't seen much in films of any sort. falls apart in the third act somewhat when the pacing goes awry and the editing goes full ADHD-mode.

there is one part where Mirage (robot character) says to the male lead: "you were inside me," then later in the same scene talks about how a small child has big testicles. later in the film, he gives the guy some contraption that attaches to the hand, then later implies that it's his penis. during his climactic sacrifice, he literally mounts the guy in missionary position.
