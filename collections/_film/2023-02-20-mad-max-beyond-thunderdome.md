insanely good, for the most part, except it gets quite boring in the second half---and yet it's still a masterpiece of worldbuilding. you can see an entire political economy in Bartertown, and the whole cultural edifice that extends from it. i was surprised at how much of Fury Road is present here: the main difference is that Fury Road has more visual treatment which i think allows him to do the signature ramping up the framerate more often.
