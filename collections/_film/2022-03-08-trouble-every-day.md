i thought this was Personal Shopper and spent the entire film looking for kristen stewart. vincent gallo is a bad actor but has a cool moustache. loved the minimal dialogue, the framing, the seemingly unrelated narrative threads. there was one shot in particular, a close-up of gallo's eyes with the camera slightly off-centre. as he's talking, the camera centres so he's staring down the lens, before shifting back to the left so his eyeline is directed at the other person in the scene. i don't think i've seen anything like that before. really incredible. this movie was fucking horrifying.
