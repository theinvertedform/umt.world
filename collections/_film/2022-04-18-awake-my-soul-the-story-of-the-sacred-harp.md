i started listening to choir music a few weeks ago after i watched Midnight Mass. it made me really want to participate, but my gf, a trained choral singer who has toured around europe, reminded me that you need to know how to read music, etc. she suggested i look into sacred harp. the companion album to this doc is pretty good: it can be emotionally resonant, but it's also a cacophonous racket. the doc was pretty nice. i'm probably not going to start singing.
