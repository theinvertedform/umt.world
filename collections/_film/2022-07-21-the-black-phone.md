it's very strange how the marketing for this film is very much positioning it as a horror film, when it is really just a suspense / thriller film. a fairly disorganized narrative. at the end, when you see the father character and his overdyed beard, i realized that the film was making a parallel between him and the antagonist pretty much entirely on the basis of a lower-half-of-the-face mask, and an extremely dark beard.
