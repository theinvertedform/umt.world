starts quite powerfully; the julliard scene that provides the plot catalyst was really well played; i was impressed throughout, but it took literally ten seconds, really just the final shot, to lose all good will. i'm (just about) as critical of cancel culture as the next cishet whiteman, but it's deeply undignified how the film sums up all its themes around artistry, genius, identity, etc as a critique based on one incident with a "pangender BIPOC" who doesn't like bach.
