Funny, tense, very tightly written. Could have done with more dialogue from Mr Tibbs. Found it a bit suspicious that the ending causes us to project our feelings of good-will onto the racist police chief, but I saw that coming from the scene in the greenhouse. It's also a bit fucked that a major plot hook depends on the rape and impregnation of a 16 year old girl, who is depicted as something like a nymphomaniac.
