This movie lost me during the scene with Jack Nicholson and his long-term GF, when he is shouting at her and she says something to the effect of "your abuse is nothing to me, it's a gift." Complete bullshit. The movie is simply not very good, and that scene, the real climax of the film, felt overplayed.

The best part was the opening section, which made me feel bad in a serious way; the banter between the two bros felt extremely real. After that, it went straight downhill.
