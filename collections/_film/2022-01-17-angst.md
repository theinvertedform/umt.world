started this on the flight back from cuba on tuesday, finished it this morning. despite all the crane shots and the large variety of camera setups, and despite being quite disturbing in parts, still manages to come across as an extremely student-tier film (perhaps simply because it relies on variety too much?). most fucked up scene was when he woke up on top of the corpse with his pants down. main guy is extremely suspect, would not be surprised if he were a real killer. forget how i came across it.
