the best of the three films at the MAC. the installation aspect of the exhibition itself was not much, but i liked the videos. this one seemed to be working with a kind of surrealism that is both andre breton and david lynch. there's the marxism of the former in the subjects chosen, and the ambient horror of the latter in the cinematic depiction of the tunnels. they form a network between the proletariat of post-industrial nations. they're connected materially, but there is also something of the unconscious in the subterranean roller-coaster rides.
