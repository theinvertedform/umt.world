trying to figure out why people seem to respond better to this one than other michael bay films. it's still quite loud, stupid, and jingoistic. my personal theory is that the film is made in the edit, and you can kinda see through the cracks how everyone is just having a good time. an extremely non-serious and low-stakes movie, despite what i'm sure is a massive budget. the drone photography was cool, but the editing became nauseous a few times (typical of my experience with michael bay). i liked how the bank robbery scene played on our knowledge of bank robbery scenes and didn't bother wasting time on the robbery itself, or establishing the police response, etc.
