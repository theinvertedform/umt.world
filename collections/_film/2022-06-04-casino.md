Very unkind to Sharon Stone's character. It's harder for me to critique the men, but Ginger was completely one-dimensional. Her fall from grace was completely shoe-horned in as a matter of narrative convention. Obviously this film is very important when considering the pre-history of The Sopranos, not just for the story of mobsters and whatnot---but for its literary modernism. The competing voice-overs are a key element of the psychological depth and fluid perspective that the film is able to achieve. The runtime is another sign that this film is building a template that would best be realized in the extended format of the television serial.
