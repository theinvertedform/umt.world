Watched this as a scary Halloween movie with a couple of young zoomers who have never seen a John Carpenter film. I wanted to watch Prince of Darkness which is his greatest, and one of my favourite movies, but I recognize that it's quite atmospheric and perhaps not an immediate crowd-pleaser. They both fell asleep immediately.
