it's always surprising to me the narrative complexity and thematic depth that people can get out of this filmmaking style. elaine may is not quite as good at it as cassavetes himself, but this is superb. loved the lofi production with all the ADR. the black bar scene in particular became something almost expressionistic. peter falk...john cassavetes...when men used to be men.
