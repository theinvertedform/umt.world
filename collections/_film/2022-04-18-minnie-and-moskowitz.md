cassavetes casting himself as the abusive lover to his real-life wife gene rowlands in a movie he wrote & directed about the fakeness of cinematic depictions of love is one of the most alpha moves i have ever seen in a movie. the acting and the titular relationship was really difficult to get a handle on, but it comes together so perfectly when seymour is screaming "you love me! i know you do!" and minnie says, "it's not there." representing the unrepresentable.
