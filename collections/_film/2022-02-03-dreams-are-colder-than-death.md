a documentary that uses interviews with black academics, educators, and every-day proletarians as the voice-over narration of a collage of imagery. the video is made of archival material, but unlike jafa's shorter works, there is less material sourced from social media / popular culture / the archive. the bulk of the footage consists of slowed-down, "still-moving-images" (as tina campt describes them). they are moving photographic portraits of the speakers, black academic celebrities; but they are also portraits of the multitude of people who compose the black social body.  these are the constituents of the culture whose object fred moten theorizes as "the critique of western civilization," and whose aim is the realization of blackness.
