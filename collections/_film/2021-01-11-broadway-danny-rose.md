really good cinematography. i haven't watched a classic woody in so long; they're actually shocking. truly, they don't make them like they used to--and in a way, i feel like that's a bad thing. filmmaking has just become so institutionalised that there is not even the remote possibility for individual idiosyncrasy.

the rope wriggling scene in particular is just something that would never get shot today in a million years--it's 100% creepy, unabashedly lascivious. the helium scene was a nice callback to woody's early slapstick. the new york street photography is fucking incredible and worth the price of admission on its own.
