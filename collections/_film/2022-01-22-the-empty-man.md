pretty creepy stuff, but i hated the ending. fits right into the modern witchcraft / cult trend, alongside Hereditary, Suspiria, Kill List, The Witch, and many others i'm not thinking of; even shares certain imagery that is common in the new witch revival. adds in some bullshit meta garbage towards the end that really spoiled it for me.
