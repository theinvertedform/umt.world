review copied from twitter...it sucked, absolute dogshit, at times its cobbled-together nature made it feel like naive/outisder art, made by someone who has never seen a movie before. i did not enjoy the experience, HOWEVER, it was heartening to see a film that was so utterly transparent. the way the main narrative conflict was very obviously going to be left unresolved, in order to force demand for a sequel; the desperate manner in which it was shoe-horned into a larger franchise narrative project. all in all, the ineptitude of the film was really refreshing. compared to The Batman, which was highly competent but so, so deeply serious; compared to most MCU films, which are not serious, but whose narratives are precision engineered to the most advanced scientific standards. morbius felt really low-stakes, its <2hr runtime another sign of how comparatively relaxed it is, especially wrt something like The Batman (WHY are you being so SERIOUS?!?). more capeshit, still operating within the superhero paradigm, but it just felt blessedly unimportant.
