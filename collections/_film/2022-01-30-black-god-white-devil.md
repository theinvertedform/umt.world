of a kind with Touki Bouki (postcolonial cinema). very cool, striking imagery, and very modernist editing and sound design. the religiousness of the plot reminded me of pasolini. liked how anticapitalist it was. it also helped me understand just how third cinema wanted to both be experimental, while also being populist: the movie was quite concerned with allowing people to follow its plot. this is a very special film and bears further study. it's going into my "revolutionary film" canon.
