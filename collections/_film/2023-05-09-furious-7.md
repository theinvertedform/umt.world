confession...i was very hung over on sunday and put on 5, 6, and 7. fell asleep 20 minutes into the first two so only logging this one. all the montage sequences with clips from the original look amazing. i kept admiring the costumes: i love how paul walker's character wears a shitty hoodie and vans, and how vin diesel wears a tanktop 100% of the time (including at his wedding). it's hilarious how bad the acting in this franchise is. everyone other than michelle rodriguez is giving ryan gosling in Drive levels of autism.
