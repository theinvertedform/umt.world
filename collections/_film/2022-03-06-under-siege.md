some of the fight scenes are like if you re-framed a slasher movie as a heroic male power fantasy. when you see an actress playing a non-character in a movie that is 100% unmitigated american imperialist masculinity, whose narrative function is to allow for the realization of certain sexual codes, i can't help but wonder if this doesn't qualify as a form of sex work. it's an actress being paid to serve as a vessel for the expression of heteronormative desire. the very minimal amount of acting associated with many of these types of performance are similar to the various social functions that get wrapped up with other forms of sex work.
