this must be one of the most "convenient" mysteries ever written. to the extent that i hardly want to call it a mystery film, because the investigation happens as though written by god, for whom all things are foretold. it's through pure narrative convenience that they get to the bottom of things. still a great movie, very fun. my favourite part was the unfolding dynamic between mr. oldboy and his jailer: a great bit of characterization.
