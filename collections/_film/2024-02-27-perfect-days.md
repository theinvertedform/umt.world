first time at cinema beaubien (watched this with french subs). great movie, loved the theme of intergenerational divides being delivered through technology, especially media technology. as a guy who is himself very attached to his rituals, watching the slow breakdown of his world was very painful. when your life is entirely structured around discipline, routine, ritual, perfect harmony---you're actually extremely vulnerable. the slightest breeze is enough to knock you over.

also interesting to note that the zoomer i watched this with found it "interminable." it's not nearly slow enough to be slow cinema, but it is "contemporary" filmmaking in the sense that it's based around process and atmosphere.
