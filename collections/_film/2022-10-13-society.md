wow this is a fucked up movie. insanely good. i thought it was exceptionally written, with a really nice structure that, refreshingly, does not let you get your footing right away. it leaves with some ambiguity at the end, too. i will say that, despite what i perceived to be overall a good script, it does lag a bit in the middle: there is a sense that the protagonist is just too much in denial, that he should be having a more active hand in the plot. very cool effects, too. the plot, the nature of the Society, does remind me a bit of my own novel.
