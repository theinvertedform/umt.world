extremely weird, borderline annoying movie whose primary aesthetic conceit seems to be the almost complete absence of any driving narrative or plot...despite being quite firmly rooted in a realistic cinematic narrative mode. seems like that would be pretty hard to do. visually restrained, with lots of careful framing and POV, but it's not really what i would call experimental. every time the film cuts off her head, i was leo pointing at the TV meme.
