DOOM: 1946 edition. despite the film being shot entirely in first-person POV, the most cutting-edge & subversive aspect of this film is making the very hardass, explicitly-coded femme fatale innocent---she even turns out to be nice in the final scene. on the few occasions you see montgomery in a reflection, he looks hilariously awkward. thinner and more slight of build than you might expect; and weirdly, i vividly remember him covering his crotch with his hat.
