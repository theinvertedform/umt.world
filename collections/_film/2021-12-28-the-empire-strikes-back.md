really really good, ofc, but i think the very slight problem i have with this and A New Hope is that because they are so tightly scripted, there is no breathing room to let anything sink in. all of the most iconic moments, like han kissing leia for the first time, and when he says "i know," all come and go so quickly because the plot is moving along at such a rapid pace. it's difficult for them to sink in, at least on a first viewing.

i really appreciated the snow battle on hoth, though. the design and ambition of it is really breathtaking. the AT-ATs are incredible, and using the speeders to trip them up...just wow.
