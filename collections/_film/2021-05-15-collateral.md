really excellent photography, performances, and characterization. the colour grading, focus, composition, shots, etc were all wonderful. absolutely loved the setting and locations chosen. great cast. kinda hated the music, which is the most dated element of it (grungy electric guitar rock, lol).

there's something weird about the lens or the camera or the framerate or--something. i think it's the same thing he did with Public Enemies. wish i understood what, exactly, is going on, and why he does it. kinda has a hyper-real quality that reminds me of soap operas.
