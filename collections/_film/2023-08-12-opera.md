yes it is quite nice visually; yes it is very funny when the rock music kicks in out of nowhere as the kills begin; yes it is like an Italian Peeping Tom. but as with probably every single giallo i have seen, the script is divided into two halves with virtually no continuity between the two. all the revelations regarding her connection to the killer, even the identity of the killer, come out of nowhere. there's no set up! 

also: is the device of a repressed memory in every single argento film?
