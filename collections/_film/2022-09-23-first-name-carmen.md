a very strange film with some surprising, shocking sexual moments. the visual texture of JLG's 80s films is so confounding to me. the films themselves are also quite confusing, but i felt quite impressed by just how much sense this one made. i felt like i had a good grasp on it and it felt overall quite coherent.
