some good moments and performances in here, but overall surprisingly weak. the cop's infatuation with laura was a bit sudden and arbitrary. i also really hated that they made the posh comedic relief guy the murderer in the end. that really felt like the script writer was running out of steam & didn't know how to wrap things up. it felt quite unsatisfying.

i will say that there were a few shots of gene tierney that emphasized aspects of her (booty) in a way that i don't think i've ever seen in a movie from this era.
