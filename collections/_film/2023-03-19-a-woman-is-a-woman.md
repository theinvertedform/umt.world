at first i had a hard time tracking the continuity between Breathless and this, JLG's second-released feature. but the continuity is there: as experimental as the sound design in this film is, it's still essentially breezy, hip, youthful, cool, fun: just like Breathless. it's political; the brechtian techniques are in full effect, with on-screen text and the jarring noise of radio ads drowning out the dialogue---but in its heart, Une femme est une femme is a work of cinephilia. in love with the American musicals it references; filtered, certainly, but godard has not yet renounced his own love of movies, as he would during the militant 70s.
