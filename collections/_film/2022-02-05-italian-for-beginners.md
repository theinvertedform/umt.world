a cute cast and a few funny & cute scenes, but overall this movie sucked. the combination of the dogme 95 rules and the rom-com genre is a cool idea, but the script was inadequate to the task and made the film come across as quite pretentious. i learned about the film several months ago, and its gimmick of bringing the dogme movement to the rom-com genre stuck with me me. in practise for the return to IRL classes, i walked to campus this morning and watched it at the VCR.
