insanely bad, just hilariously bad. somehow jared leto comes off best because he seemed to be the only one actually playing for laughs. it's confusing when The Last Duel was so good, i have to assume because it had the most powerful of hollywood power couples (damon/affleck) involved, and they had enough sense to push that film away from the realm of fake italian accents. it felt like ridley was deeply out of his element in this setting; some of the choices, like playing "faith" during the wedding scene, were simultaneously deeply confounding and deeply embarrassing to witness. all i could think about while watching was this old guy surrounded by 1000 advisors asking him about wardrobes, props, music, everything; and he just doing his best to make it all come together.
