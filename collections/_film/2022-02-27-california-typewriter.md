tom hanks sold me on a smith corona silent. but the shots of that refurbished red de luxe were really incredible. the director didn't label the talking heads, which was an interesting choice, so i don't know who most of these people are; but imo the emphasis on the physical material produced by the typewriter by the majority of speakers is not quite the right approach. the typewriter is an important part of the process: really good for untethering and unlocking, significantly less good for editing. i wrote the first draft of my novel on a typewriter, then transcribed it to the computer for editing + backup. unsurprisingly i also use the loudest keyboard i could find.
