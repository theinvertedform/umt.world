2020-10-01,Feels Good Man,2020,https://boxd.it/1nEmZP,2.5,,"A sequel to TFW No GF, but from the perspective of the opposite side--the normie Matt Furie, who gets drawn into incel-land. Tries to get philosophical when one of the guests begins talking about ""meme magic,"" and explains a bit of the cosmology of Kek. Many of the guests have pedigree, at least compared to the guests from TFW No GF.

The problem is that the explorations are not satisfyingly deep, and a narrative is imposed with a somewhat heavy hand on the documentary material. Additionally, the film lacks a satisfying conclusion to the character arc. The open-endedness of the future of Pepe was a strong aspect of the film, but the cast of characters is not as interesting to me as those in TFW No GF.",,2020-09-30
2020-10-01,Flirting with Disaster,1996,https://boxd.it/1nEnxn,2,,"A little rom-com that I watched in the background while doing some coding. I liked Ben Stiller's high-waisted, pleated wool pants, and the oversized shirt tucked into them--very 90s, very cool. I liked Patricia Arquette's mom look, and Josh Brolin was great. Also really loved the second son of the main character's parents, in the final section of the movie.",,2020-09-30
2020-10-01,Notting Hill,1999,https://boxd.it/1nEof5,2,,"This film almost said something deep about the nature of love, but in the end didn't quite manage to say anything meaningful. Maybe I only thought it got close to saying something deep because it was affecting, and made me remember some of those supercharged moments when you meet someone, and I want it to justify itself.",,2020-09-29
2020-10-01,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,2011,https://boxd.it/1nErEx,2.5,,"Bon look, not great for watching in the background. Too much plot, but it was easy to understand at the end by assuming that ""the craziest thing"" had to happen, because it's a highly crafted spy movie. Lots of men, bald and otherwise, and British unhealthiness.",,2020-09-29

2020-10-02,Mission: Impossible - Fallout,2018,https://boxd.it/1nLrP5,,,"Mission Impossible films are truly about nothing. Pure spectacle, the plots are an echo from the time period of the first film. A cabal of ""anarchists"" with no greater motivation than to destroy, and who use a nuclear bomb, no less? It's from another period of history, and is completely devoid of any subtext that makes the film ""about"" something more than its plot. 

The chase scenes through Paris were pretty cool, as was the first fight scene in the washroom.",,2020-10-01
2020-10-04,In the Heat of the Night,1967,https://boxd.it/1nYFbT,3,,"Funny, tense, very tightly written. Could have done with more dialogue from Mr Tibbs. Found it a bit suspicious that the ending causes us to project our feelings of good-will onto the racist police chief, but I saw that coming from the scene in the greenhouse. It's also a bit fucked that a major plot hook depends on the rape and impregnation of a 16 year old girl, who is depicted as something like a nymphomaniac.",,2020-10-03

2020-10-14,My Octopus Teacher,2020,https://boxd.it/1p64G1,2.5,,"Lots of gross imagery. The seal pups and otters at the end were a relief from all the freaky bugs. I really didn't understand this movie; I thought it was extremely bizarre, and when the dude was crying toward the end about his dead octopus (lover?), well, I just felt like it was pretty strange!

I thought the queer theoretical reading on Twitter was a bit arbitrary. Death of the author and all, it's fine, I can see how Sophie derived her reading from the film, and I don't think the extreme backlash is justified--but it does feel somewhat irrelevant to the text itself.",,2020-10-13
2020-10-17,Scream,1996,https://boxd.it/1pokKp,3,,"Surprisingly well written. Really the direction was the weak link with this movie, as well as the editing. Something in the sound mix was off--I had to struggle to hear the dialogue.

I liked all the more subtle meta aspects of the film, before it got really heavy-handed in the third act. It felt nice and subtle, like Cabin in the Woods but, ~20 years before that film.",,2020-10-16
2020-10-21,Full Frontal,2002,https://boxd.it/1pQbtZ,3,,"Very cool structural film, pretty typical Soderbergh experimentation. Layers. I thought it was all pretty subtle and well-crafted, not meta in an annoying way. The moment when the film-within-the-film is revealed as such felt pretty cool and climactic. The keyhole sex scene was simply gorgeous, and there are many other very gorgeous moments in the film.

What I will say is that, although the formalism stands the test of time, the actual drama in both this film, and Sex, Lies & Videotape don't quite. The relationships and dynamics explored are a bit typical, and don't entirely hold interest for the entire duration. Something about them is just very classic and identifiable as 90s indie drama.",,2020-10-20

2020-10-23,The Endless,2017,https://boxd.it/1pY7VV,0.5,,"this, and its sequel, were so fucking bad. immature garbage. my constant thought throughout this film as well as Resolution was how IMMATURE it is to make this type of extremely meta film. absolute trash. made me want to revisit Funny Games, though, and see how it is able to use a similar gimmick but to a much greater effect.

ultimately, this shit is just so goddamn immature, pure masturbatory garbage, pure trash, i hated this film and resolution.",,

2020-10-27,Don't Look Now,1973,https://boxd.it/1qyiTD,2.5,,"Phenomenal editing, sound design, production design, and mise-en-scene; really nice looking actors wearing nice costumes in a beautiful, run-down Venice. Great locations and cinematography. Story was extremely boring: felt like there were long stretches where nothing was happening, and the ending was particularly bad. Despite the montage of scenes and images from throughout the film, unless I'm missing something--there was nothing in the story or the content of the film to foreshadow or give any clue to the ending.

Perhaps it's symbolic in some way, and I'll think about it a bit more, but if that's so, the symbolism was insufficiently developed, or there was no cipher given to decode it.

Also wasn't scary.",,2020-10-26

2020-11-02,Breakfast at Tiffany's,1961,https://boxd.it/1rh569,4,Yes,"The party scene remains one of my all-time favourite party scenes in cinema, alongside the rave scene from Spaced.

You can really see how Paul is written as a gay guy and his character remains essentially that throughout the first 3/4 of the film, until the abrupt shift when he becomes a love interest. Something about his first move doesn't quite sit right with me--if he were straight, and as smooth and nice a guy as he is presented to be, I think it would have done more for their sexual and romantic chemistry if he had played it out a bit longer. He should not have simply kissed her at the end of their day playing together, but rather not kissed her so that she would become perplexed and her desire for him would be supercharged. That's my pickup advice: create extremely romantic situations and a sexually charged atmosphere, but then hold off on actually making a move, which will cause her to begin to thirst, and initiate the process of making a move.

Not only does it increase her desire while preserving your face, but it also makes it so once the desire becomes consummated by the woman, consent is unambiguously given without the need to demystify the encounter by asking for it.",,2020-11-01
2020-11-02,The Thing,2011,https://boxd.it/1rimF3,2.5,Yes,"Watching this a few days after the original caused me to realize that all those Ridley Scott additions to the Alien franchise try to play off what made John Carpenter's film so great. Coming across a bunch of action post-factum, and not having a clear understand of the mystery of it, is an important part of the original film's power. This one is fine, but those newer Alien movies are really just strip-mining cosmic horror. Attempting to intrigue with mystery, but at the same time completely eradicating all mystery and expositing the story to the most extreme degree possible. ",,2020-11-01
2020-11-05,But I'm a Cheerleader,1999,https://boxd.it/1rAfyb,2.5,,"At first I thought it was a piece of ""outsider art,"" but after a bit I settled into viewing it as just a very dated film with some fairly complex social significance. Not very good, but interesting, and has a pretty disorienting overall aesthetic. It's still just a bit too polished and intentional to really qualify as ""outsider.""

It did make me realize that all the music I loved as a teenager was pretty lesbian.",,2020-11-04
2020-11-08,The King of Comedy,1982,https://boxd.it/1rPqcl,3.5,,"Unbelievable performances, especially from Bobby De Niro. His best imo. I think the ending was meant to reflect reality, and that's the only way it can possibly be read.",,2020-11-06

2020-11-12,Donnie Brasco,1997,https://boxd.it/1sgRAj,3,,"Extremely emotional and ""soft"" mob movie. The relationship between Pacino and Depp is really touching, heartfelt, moving, and it's nice how there is not a lot of masculine posturing that separates them. I thought it was a bit difficult to follow the main plot involving the various crime families and whatnot, but there was a yapping puppy rolling on the floor distracting me.

I also thought it was cool how little action there was. Really, this was just a serious, emotional drama in the guise of a mob film. It doesn't really follow the same glorified and gleeful arcs of a lot of other films in this genre, especially from the big S Man himself.

I really liked Depp and his moustache in this film. I felt motivated to read it after reading some thread comparing it to Goodfellas, and saying that it looked like a made-for-TV film. Something about it, in the OP's eyes, looked of a lesser quality. Much of the thread was people talking about how the washed-out and grey colour-grading was a trend in cinema at the time. People are fucking dumbasses, especially on Reddit. This movie looked great, and was a far more serious character study and dramatic narrative, with much more heartfelt performances and intimate moments between character types who are so often cloaked in masculinity, than any Casino or Goodfellas.",,2020-11-11

2020-12-07,They Live,1988,https://boxd.it/1v047x,2.5,Yes,"this movie starts really good, very strong atmosphere anchored in an incredible setting, but the third act gets quite bad, i'm sorry to say. too much action, and it loses the atmospheric horror vibe that made it so good.

the film also highlights the worst things about carpenter's films: he can't really have a female character unless they are being near-raped; he can't have characters in general. the main guy in this movie says a lot of funny one-liners, but they feel really incongruous in carpenter's oeuvre, more a product of the actor trying to have a good time than something carpenter actually directed.

so not carpenter's best, not a very consistent film, but the first act just absolutely kills the atmosphere, the setting, the soundtrack, all of it.",,2020-12-06

2020-12-13,Avatar,2009,https://boxd.it/1vAATl,2.5,Yes,"fell for the chapo hype. haven't seen this since it first came out. it was about as good and also about as cheesy as i remember. sure, the anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist and anti-american themes are real, but it's still essentially a hollywood film and still works within that paradigm. to truly be ""revolutionary,"" to truly have political potential, even, i think it would have to incorporate some brechtian alienation effects and that's really the opposite of what it does, with the next-level VFX.

the effects look really nice, i will say. they haven't aged much, and they are just incredibly detailed and well-rendered. it's a decent film, worth re-watching, though i prefer T2 any day.",,2020-12-11

2020-12-22,Kiss Me Deadly,1955,https://boxd.it/1wFSax,3,,"feels aesthetically like an extended episode of the twilight zone. not in a condescending way, and not only because of the scifi elements of the plot. 50s aesthetics are just so distinct from decades prior; whereas the 40s and downward feel more cognitively distinct as from another historical era--definitely ancient, definitely from a very distant past--the 50s feels close to the contemporary, but it still has that antique edge to it. i'm talking about the production design.

maybe that has to do with the non-cinematic qualities of this film and the production design (again), including costuming. i feel like, in a lot of 50s films that aren't headed by big stars that we still recognize today, the actors look extremely normal--as though they are non-actors pulled off the street.

i think that this film is just not cinematic in its production design and casting. it's still quite good, though, and very relaxing. i like 50s american genre films because they function as relaxing, low-stakes movies that you can half pay attention to, but the cinematic conventions of the time are still infinitely classier than those of today; and there is not this potential alienation of watching movies from earlier decades, whose antiquity might make them hard to digest for the brain-addled.",,2020-12-21

Complete bullshit. The movie is simply not very good, and that scene, the real climax of the film, felt overplayed.

the rope wriggling scene in particular is just something that would never get shot today in a million years--it's 100% creepy, unabashedly lascivious. the helium scene was a nice callback to woody's early slapstick. the new york street photography is fucking incredible and worth the price of admission on its own.",,2021-01-10

2021-02-02,Prince of Darkness,1987,https://boxd.it/1DkGnl,5,Yes,"probably my fourth of fifth viewing of this film. i still love it: the climactic scene in the corridor is certainly the best example of lovecraftian horror i've seen in film. the overall atmosphere is so good, too. carpenter is a very atmospheric filmmaker, but in this one he just does it so well.

it's really unfortunate that it has as many cheesy elements as it does. the kills, the liquid, the characters, some of the acting, some of the writing. The Thing is a much better overall film with the same lovecraftian cosmic horror atmosphere, but its soundtrack and vibe are not quite on par with this. The Thing is too close to something like an action or a conventional monster movie, whereas Prince of Darkness is pretty uncompromisingly cerebral.

there's some weird stuff going on with the relationship between the two lead actors, and the overall dynamics between men and women in the film. i think it's intentional, there were a few lines of dialogue that made the antagonism between the sexes explicit. i wonder if it's supposed to be another effect of nega-god's encroachment into our world, or if the parallel goes the other way?

this movie has a real ""looseness"" to it that i remember from The Wild Bunch, almost an outsider quality; a slight degree of incompetence. in a lot of ways, this movie reminded me of a jean-luc godard film. in particular the scene between benny and his love interest under the tree, which just went on for way too long. i liked that; i also did enjoy the depravity, the unhingedness of the film. it felt like the kind of movie godard would have made in his ""Weekend"" era, if he were american (less culturally and formally refined).

2021-03-07,Rocky II,1979,https://boxd.it/1HVzuz,,Yes,"damn this is so much fucking worse than the first one. the training montage is not really significantly better than in the first, which is kinda what i remembered this one having; the cinematography is so much worse--the first had all these incredible wide, deep shots of stunning urban decay, cool angles, etc.

the script for the first was really perfectly executed as well; super minimal, incredibly effective. this one is also very workmanlike in the same kinda way--formulaic, not necessarily in a negative sense, but not really able to express creativity within the confines of the formula. the script for the first rocky movie was formulaic but still just perfectly structured. so much heart.

i thought that the montage sequence with Eye of the Tiger was in this one. now i feel like i have blue balls and i'm just chasing it down. gotta watch rocky 3, it must be there.

this movie was not very good, but i still like it because i just love training montages, i can't help it. i love inspiration based around physicality.

2021-03-14,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,2012,https://boxd.it/1IJcur,,Yes,"constantly shifting from ""this is a kid's movie, nice"" to ""this is extremely inappropriate for children."" the first scene with bilbo and gandalf for example is classic kid's stuff--extremely goofy, simple. the whole thing in the hobbit house with the dwarves--kids love that shift, presumably. but then you go to fucking terrifying hi-res orcs chopping off the heads of dwarves and screaming to their wargs to drink their blood and whatnot--not to mention the elf council scenes--i wish this movie had just followed the book in being directed PRIMARILY at children.

the songs, too, lmao, are definitely for kids. and the gollum scene--which was incredible--was also terrifying. gollum looks incredible in this film, but he is unquestionably terrifying. the goblin-king is terrifying, etc.

i found that the visuals looked weird maybe 45% of the time, being generous. i thought they looked cool during the large battle scene with the orcs and the dwarves, for example; but the elves all looked really weird. some of the scenes look like videogame cutscenes, especially the escape from the dungeon.

overall the action sequences, which are far more plentiful, are also a lot more cartoonish and action-movie-like. the scene with the dwarves jumping and flipping off of each other? ridiculous.

having just watched the LOTR trilogy, there are definitely sequences in those films, some of the special effects, that look bad, no doubt (gollum for eg, and all of the big fantasy locations). but the real-ness of the orcs in particular, and the groundedness of the battles, are absolutely incredible. wish they had just made this using the exact same techniques, but used SFX sparingly in order to improve what was lacking from that trilogy.

i also hated how many deus ex machinas were used in this film, extremely lazy writing. the movie dragged painfully, and not just because of the length: it simply wasn't compellingly written. the LOTR films could have gone on forever. disappoint!",,2021-03-12

2021-08-12,The Green Knight,2021,https://boxd.it/23PqjN,,,"the editing and a few of the pacing choices, especially early on, really threw me off. there are certain elements, like the momentum of the introductory scene (not the pre-credit ode), that suggested the film was meant to be a light-hearted satire. as well, some of the graphic elements of the film. however, the rest of the time, the film was played entirely straight and serious, as an epic surrealist fantasy hero's quest. i personally didn't find that those two qualities mixed particularly well, so the entire thing felt off-balance.

there were some good sequences, like all of the bits with King Arthur--i really loved that performance. i also found the sex scene to be quite powerful.

thinking back, i'm not entirely sure what the relationship between gawain's mother and the green knight was supposed to be. she summoned this wood-knight to challenge her son so that he could prove himself by rejecting the protection she offered? not a bad theme, and a certain oedipal dynamic does reoccur--as in the callback to his mother during the aforementioned sex scene.

2021-08-26,The Forever Purge,2021,https://boxd.it/25TVjP,,,"At times it felt like this movie was intentionally blunting itself, because if they wrote the speeches coming from the Purgers to be effective, they would be shockingly close to reality.

Ultimately the politics of this film are quite anti-proletariat. They are very much a combination of woke identity politics and liberal American capitalist values. The class conflict in the first act of the film is quickly discarded in favour of making the film a race war.

The Purge films are almost uniformly marred by schlocky filmmaking, but what's really frustrating about the series is that they are intentionally made to represent issues of identity as the primary factor responsible for violence and conflict within the United States, rather than issues of class. With each subsequent piece of the franchise, socioeconomic inequality as the motivating force of the purge is subsumed within the true evil: racial division.",,2021-08-25

It got especially confusing for me at the end, when they started piling themes and imagery on top of each other. It became difficult for me to keep track of the plot / mythology, as well as the themes (I suspect that the gentrification / race theme was, in fact, abandoned). Not sure what the bees were about, not sure what the witch's pyre was about.

Some quite frightening images / sequences, like around the toilet. I never saw this in the 90s, but I certainly remember it. 

I love the device of academics as the basis of a horror film. My favourite horror film, Prince of Darkness, is also about academics.

The second is that society has become so oversaturated with images, that the younger generation are unquestionably experiencing an inferior form of cinematic culture. This is not to say that they are ""suffering,"" as though shittier films is some great tragedy; just that the standard has lowered and everything is uniformly worse. However, to bring it back around to Danny Boyle, the key is to accept that and understand (1) that there will still be artists who arise out of the sea of shit; and (2) represent the old school, fight the dying of the light, and try to find something to pass on from a time when things were marginally better.",,2021-09-24

2022-01-01,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,https://boxd.it/2q33or,,,"throughout the entire runtime of this film, i was constantly crunching the numbers, trying to keep my finger on the underlying principles that led lana wachowski to introduce epic soybants into the matrix trilogy. characters only repeat the word ""mode"" like 500 times, so i was able to surmise that this film is operating in a different (realistic) mode than the original trilogy, which does seem like a successful starting point for making a new matrix film. incorporating different cinematic modalities into the meta-text of the film was a pretty bold and creative move, possibly the best thing the film has going for it, although it does result in some truly weird disjunctions: i always took it for granted that the world of the original trilogy was a fantasy world, devoid of characters aside from the chosen few (that's what the colour palette is all about, after all); so the fact that there are characters in this film whose turning point occurs after witnessing neo's antics seems to go against the spirit of the original in a way that does not get smoothed over by the complicated layering. this film's thematic puzzle gets me half-way to the point of forgiving the front-loaded, ironic meta-commentary on the film's production, which is typically one of the most cringe and juvenile narrative elements an author has at their disposal; but is the film's puzzlework just a distraction?

despite all the high-level calculus i was doing while watching---and desperate as i was to uncover the basis upon which the film justifies its use of soybants---the question is whether or not it all works. at the level of enjoyment, for me the film does not work. as unpleasant and jarring as it is to see the morpheus character delivering whedonesque dialogue, i can forgive that specific element because soybants are a cornerstone of contemporary culture, and therefore are a key element of the film's narrative about how the machines are all-consuming liberalism. however---and this might betray my essential lack of regard for what constitutes the bulk of the matrix films, which are big, dumb, spectacular fights---most, if not all of the action in this one felt curiously impactless. i am choosing to believe this is another intentional choice on the part of the artist as further détournement of the matrix legacy. my favourite action sequences in the original were always the ones that combined fighting with a chase or otherwise interesting, dynamic set piece; rather than when the epic power scale of neo and agent smith's rivalry becomes a matter of them trading blows toe-to-toe. the best action sequence in this film, for me, was the opening sequence. 

whether it works at a narrative level is another question. over the two and a half hour runtime, i did become fatigued and at certain points released myself from trying to track what was happening, even on the surface of the long expository scenes. i did not find it as torturous as my gf, who left the room about a third of the way through; and it's not quite so bad as to deserve opprobrium; but whatever thread holds the film together from beginning to end is incredibly thin, possibly designed to only be discernible through re-watching on the HBO Max streaming platform.",tv,2021-12-30

the film itself was quite off-putting; i had a hard time following the narrative and getting a handle on the structure. something about the editing and pacing for the first half felt really strange: cold, alienating, no music, relentlessly moving from one scene to the next. the focus of the film moved around a lot, and seemed to settle on the main character arbitrarily. the main dramatic event at the centre of the film seemed to come at a really strange place. i want to say the film was ""postmodern"" for the cold and seemingly arbitrary pacing and perspectival focus of the first half, which certainly fits with the arbitrariness and randomness of the main ""event"" of the film. like a true tragedy, it strikes at random: ""the hand of god."" the placement of the Main Event in the film really kinda knocked the structure of the film off-kilter for me, but i think the film was intentionally made to be lopsided in order to better reflect the nature of real life tragedy (hence ""postmodern"" ?). anyway not giving this the heart because despite some nice titties, i didn't really enjoy the experience overall.",dollar cinema,2022-03-04

one scene in particular that stood out to me is the dinner party, where the couple reveal the premise of the film to their friends. the characters' movements are over-micced, so the sound of cutlery etc has as much presence in the mix as the dialogue. a very deliberate move that reminds me of Jeanne Dielman. it's an extremely subtle technique that almost subliminally alienates the audience from identifying with the realism of the scene, which i think is the main objective of this film: to problematize the audience's relationship with media.",laptop,2022-03-06

the film is really heavy-handed, not subtle at all. the themes are explicitly stated very early on, and repeated frequently by a multitude of different characters. this, as well as the film's overall melodramatic obviousness (all the needle drops!!) are points against it...but it's undeniably a fun watch.","de seve, fmst 222",2022-03-10

a lot of aschenbach's backstory as a composer (rather than a writer, as in the novel), and the conversations about art with his buddy, seem to be lifted from elsewhere in mann's corpus & life (particularly, Doctor Faustus). it's interesting to make that connection between the homoeroticism of the film's primary theme, with the autobiographic elements taken from the novella and from mann's work in general. i thought the camera which recurs, and which is present in the foreground of the crucial climactic shot of the film, might be trying to draw some kind of parallel between visconti and mann.

anyway what i wanted to say is that burnett is, kind of amazingly, able to transplant his approach into a studio context; and even in a film that deals more explicitly with the structures of white supremacy (police) than his previous films, he still approaches the subject obliquely and from within. obviously the two main leads, a black man and a white woman, are both sheriffs. outsiders, but nonetheless part of the institution that is being critically represented. both make repeated references to how good a job it is, and how they are motivated primarily by money. neither of them are really committed to the institution, and JJ only becomes committed to exposing its corruption after he becomes complicit in it. all in all, a masterful film.",vcr,2022-03-21

Bless Their Little Hearts was mostly about economic inequality, gender, and family/relationship dynamics: as i recall there are only a few references in that film to the possibility of crime, and i can't recall if there is any representation of the police. Bush Mama does revolve around a family, but it is more concerned with police violence (multiple shootings) and imprisonment. also, it is explicitly political in a way that woodberry's film is not: there is a character who talks about demos, the BPP, malcolm X, persecution by the police, etc etc. the main character seems to wander around, trying to process her situation and the various messages she is receiving. the film seems to represent the coming-to-be of a political consciousness.

there are ideas at the heart of this, even if they are not the most complicated versions of those ideas. the experimental cinematic elements are, yes, undeniably pop-flavoured; but they are still successful in establishing a recognizable, popular rhythm (Endgame)---and then bringing it to another level that audiences know a film like Endgame could never rise to. in a jam packed, humongous auditorium, with a crowd hanging on every beat, sequences like the rocks. as well as the constant montages, are have a palpable effect. the film is undeniably successful in presenting its subject matter to a mass audience. again, the level that it rises to might not be as experimental as we might like; it might simplify Nietzsche's sublation of nihilism in order to fit it into the narrative, but the film is deeper and more cinematically experimental than most other films, while also being funny and popular. 

minor things that bothered me: they spent way, way too long in that office location. that was annoying. i also thought there could have been more work done to integrate the relationship conflict between yeoh & her husband character, with the primary conflict between yeoh and her daughter character. the resolution of the primary conflict overshadowed that of the secondary conflict to the extent that i'm having trouble recalling just how it was even accomplished. for maximum scriptwriting points, you would have to integrate the two conflicts so that the primary mother/daughter conflict depended on the resolution of the husband/wife conflict.",cinéma cineplex forum,2022-05-10

i will also say, and this is going to sound like a bit of an asshole critique, but the story of a quantum computer that can know all based on data analysis, it's a bit of an obvious story. it's good, it's intriguing, and it's well enough told, but it's a very simple & obvious concept. the ending adds some complexity, though.

2022-06-04,Men,2022,https://boxd.it/2TG6PT,,,"It's a bit strange to me that Alex Garland, who started out as a novelist before becoming a scriptwriter before becoming a film director, has created a film that is more successful on a cinematic level than are its narrative and themes. Not only does he have a distinct visual style very much in evidence across works like Ex Machina, Annihilation, and Devs; but he is also working a lot with sound design (especially in Devs), yet another formal element that is distinct from the literary. Is there anything this guy can't do?! A complete aesthete. 

The first act of Men is a very competent psychological suspense/thriller film, with only a few moments of horror that break through the atmosphere. The themes of toxic masculinity are fairly clear through the second act...but eventually, the film tries to make connections between its one-dimensional men and the folk horror elements that recur in abstract montages...but the script does not actually connect these elements in a successful manner. It's not simply a matter of ambiguity: the idea that toxic masculinity is a perpetual cycle springing from some pagan root, and that it reduces all specificity (different men) to the universal (toxic man) is evident enough. Neither is the problem a lack of exposition, like ""what sort of creature"" is the Kinnear character. The problem is that these connections are half-assed, and such an interpretation is essentially generous: there is no evident justification for why the pagan elements are included, or why they are relevant to the Buckley character's narrative. 

I thought narrative was supposed to be Garland's strong suit?! Practical effects might make him a ""real"" ""film maker,"" but unfortunately this bonafide comes at the expense of being a real ""writer."" Still gets the heart because I'm being unnecessarily harsh in this review, and it's still a pretty decent movie.

EDIT: I shouldn't be surprised by this, but after skimming the film's ""reception history"" (reviews on Letterboxd), it seems like the general interpretation of the film is extremely uncharitable. ""I'm one of the good ones."" I think that the final act makes it clear that Garland is trying to do something more complex than simply virtue signal. I obviously cannot speak to what motivated him to want to do that from the outset, but in my opinion the cycle of wet birth and rebirth that we witness, as well as the recurring Pagan images, are critical of ""toxic masculinity"" as well as the counter-masculine discourse. There is a clear connection being made between something primordial within the species, and the male characters present in the film. My point of critique of this film is that it doesn't come together---the double-edged critique really needs to be gleaned---but regardless, I don't think this film lends itself to reductive ""all men, just not me"" dismissal.",cinéma du parc,2022-05-31

an interesting combination of friedkin's gritty, neorealist filmmaking style with 80s LA aesthetic. the soundtrack is extremely heavy on the synth bass; the title card is neon green and pink; the credits are in a curly California font. the narrative is extremely, extremely noir, which i adored quite a lot. the ending especially (minus the stinger) sinks the landing so deliciously. incredibly bleak, violent, hopeless, all of which i loved. perhaps most socially critical was the moment between the main guy's partner and his ""love interest,"" the informant character, when the partner embraces his fallen position and steps in to keep the cycle of corruption and exploitation going. the performances in this are really, really good. obviously dafoe stands out to me, but the two main cop characters are wonderfully portrayed as well.

one thing i will say is that i feel like i am chasing something in the ""neo-noir"" genre that is just a bit more complicated, that addresses itself to the genre. it seems like a lot of neo-noir is content to take the conventions of the genre, and bring them to a heightened level that would not have been socially or cinematically possible in the 40s: more sex, violence, gore, action, corruption, drugs, blahblah...i'm chasing the high of The Big Lebowski and Under the Silver Lake.

Tropical Malady, shot on what seems like a prosumer video camera, also struck me for the purely visual quality of the image---disregarding shot composition, etc. The pixelated grain of the jungle in that film was such an interesting and beautiful contrast. Uncle Boonmee doesn't have that same video grain (shot in 16mm), but the photography is really gorgeous. The sequence with the catfish stands out; as well, the descent into the caves, when the camera is handheld and the audio track is dominated by the sound of breathing...really cool stuff.

Thematically, there is quite a lot of continuity between this film and Tropical Malady, right down to a character basically telling the story of the second half of that film. The credits refer to the film as a ""primitive project,"" and there is obviously quite a lot about rural superstition (or more generously, spirituality). There is a sequence early on when one character makes fun of a Laotian character's dialect; another sequence where the titular uncle expresses regret for killing so many communists. In the final act, we move from the rural setting back into the urban, and we have another interesting contrast of the spiritual and the modern in the form of the zen monk's robes, discarded in favour of jeans and Chuck Taylor's. There's something going on about (1) the idiocy of rural folk; (2) modernity; (3) photographic media, including photography, an important part of the plot; and TV, which brings a surprising meta-textual quality to the ending of the film.

When I saw Tropical Malady, I had a pretty shallow interpretation that was just about how traditional, folk spirituality is better than modern life, blahblahblah. But there's a political subtext to this film that is a bit more critical.",cinéma moderne,2022-06-11
2022-06-17,Top Gun: Maverick,2022,https://boxd.it/2VZgDf,,,"this movie was dogshit and everyone who says otherwise is a stooge. ""oh the action is so good, it's just innocent fun, the power of cinema blahblah."" bro, you are mainlining the ideology of the most evil empire that has ever reigned. this movie is satanic, and if you are able to forget that and enjoy the drum machines and constant golden hour footage then you are just marching along to the imperial drum. 

tom cruise is a deeply sinister cultural figure. the mission: impossible franchise can be fun, because the superspy premise is pretty fantastical  and there is blissfully no attempt to develop that character; but seeing him in this film, literally wearing his Sea Org outfit, spouting platitudes stolen from yoda, saluting LRH proxies---it's all deeply creepy. i am as confounded that he is able to pull the wool over so many eyes as when he blew a gasket because some gaffer's mask slipped below their nose back at the beginning of the pandemic. that audio gave me PTSD flashbacks. knowing what goes on inside the church of scientology, it is so clear that his unfazed, unflinching confidence is the result of decades of psychological torture (""auditing""). imagine the scene in taxi driver where travis holds his fist over the flame to harden himself, except it's people screaming at you for hours straight, inches from your face, and if you flinch you get put back in the hole. this is quite literally the cat-o-nine-tails that tom cruise self-flagellates with; and being such an honoured member of the church, there is no doubt that he has an unlimited supply of new trainees to abuse. he is not a ""movie star,"" he is a ""traumatized, hollowed-out shell of a person."" 

when tom cruise crash lands among the hoi polloi, the film treats him as a martian; when he is seen ""socializing"" at a bar, he is on the outside, looking in with his blank and uncanny stare. it's because he is a freak, he is not a human being; if his mind were a landscape, it would be a burnt cinder. tom cruise has never had a ""normal"" interaction with anyone in his life. this film's great failing, where Mission: Impossible knows its limits, is in challenging him to play a character with depth (i.e. relationships to others that are not purely hierarchical).

the real ideological core of this film is less related to the militarism and apolitical conflict at the centre of the narrative: it's the individualism that feeds back into ideas of the amerikkkan dream. everyone has the potential to be a hero: the onus is on the individual to secure the motherland, as well as their own personal liberty. if you are not free, it's your fault; if your country is not secure, it's your fault. and if your country is secure, or if you are free, it is not by the grace of the social fabric, which an individual might presume to share in---no, it is because of some individual hero off somewhere who has single-handedly managed to solve whatever threatened the nation. the real poison of this film is more to do with the extreme individualist themes that saturate every layer of the narrative and its characters, and less so with the fighter jets and the occlusion of political conflict. yes this individualism is present in the story about the military, but as people are so fond of pointing out, this film is also self-reflective about the Top Gun legacy, as well as the status of its star. the cultural side of the ideology of individual exceptionalism is half of the coin, where the other half is the literal war machine: the fighter jets, the bombs, the naval air carriers, etc.

2022-06-19,Blow Out,1981,https://boxd.it/2WoaTh,,Yes,"Forgot that I had seen this film before, but it all came back to me during the tech-fetishist sequences of John Travolta editing film and audio. It demands a certain suspension of disbelief to accept that a supposedly trashy film production company would have such nice offices and equipment, but it pays off in the same glorification of analogue media that made Antonioni's Blow-up so viscerally engaging. De Palma relies on a hardware aesthetic that matches the film's paranoid political thriller narrative, but he is just as much relying on the cutting edge of horror filmmaking. From the opening sequence, a scene from a slasher film-within-the-film whose first person POV references Halloween (1978)---and whose sorority-set shower kill could be a reference to de Palma's own Carrie (1976)---Blow Out references the changing contemporary state of horror films. De Palma pulls tricks without reservation, bent on innovating on the thriller genre to create something modern; something befitting this era of the American film industry's paradigm shift to the blockbuster model.

Blow Out has one foot in the past of its film noir precedents; but its other, John Travolta-shaped foot is in a Hollywood star-based industry that could nevergo as dark as a film like Farewell My Lovely (1975). Mitchum was a star, too, but from another era. In Blow Out, when the car goes off the bridge, Travolta dives unhesitatingly into the water to save the girl: as a cultural icon, he is too dependent on a sanitized culture industry. Travolta's character start out as an unassuming hero among ordinary people, who becomes disillusioned over the course of the film. The same basic arc plays out in the darkest classic Hollywood films, but the difference is that the arc generally occurs within a social milieu where the standards of heroism and redemption are much lower. The most noir-ish elements of this film are contained in the side plot with the killer; and in the general atmosphere of paranoia surrounding the political elements of the narrative. Explicit political references are not common in your standard film noir, Pickup on South Street not withstanding. I mention this just because I think I saw ""neo-noir"" attached to this film, but to me it just feels like a pretty typical-of-the-age conspiracy thriller.

Nancy Allen's character was significantly underwritten, and for the first half of the film she felt quite two-dimensional. Ultimately I think the script and the film itself stifle her; but there comes a turning point where I felt like I clued into what she was doing. She is playing a character type from the 40s: not a femme fatale, really, but more like an erstwhile love interest & co-conspirator. She sticks to one note for pretty much the entire film, but she does manage to get a lot of depth out of that one note. Not enough said here, but I can only say that her performance is ""magnetic"" despite an annoying script and very stupid direction. I don't know anything about Nancy Allen, but I am naming her 1981's ""One to Watch.""",tv,2022-06-17
2022-06-20,This Gun for Hire,1942,https://boxd.it/2WEv4L,,,"Top notch and under-represented b-noir. Every character in this is memorable and fully drawn-out, with distinctive costumes and a unique personality. An excellent script that is able to make every henchman, villain, and cop a memorable character, even if they only have a few lines. The mise-en-scene helps to quite effectively accentuate the effect of such a varied cast of characters. Not only does everyone get a memorable line and a kooky personality, but they also get interesting outfits! I also, somehow, unexpectedly, found myself quite charmed and invested in the relationship between the heroine and her cop boyfriend. Probably just because Veronica Lake is absolutely smoking hot in this.

The script is really cool; it kinda made me think of a screwball comedy for its fast-paced barrage of period-specific slangy quips---the obvious comparison being His Girl Friday (1940). One memorable sequence is when Veronica Lake puts her hand on the thigh of the titular gun for hire, played by Alan Ladd, trying to flirt her way out of being held hostage, and he accuses her for trying to make him go soft. Bro, she's trying to make you HARD!!!

2022-06-20,Vive L'Amour,1994,https://boxd.it/2WEMn1,,,"A very arbitrary comparison, made strictly on the basis of seeing them in the same slot at the same cinema a week apart, but I liked this a lot more than Uncle Boonmee. That film is quite challenging; Vive L'Amour is deeply layered and has a very distinct and well-articulated visual style, but it felt easier for me to get a handle on what's going on. The themes and the narrative are just so perfectly unified. The final (two) sequences really brought it all together: the sexual awakening and subsequent experience of intimacy on the part of the two male characters---and the complete absence of intimacy experienced by the female character. She walks alongside a bulldozed mudpit of a park and has a breakdown after her one night stand, and after a movie spent scarfing down food standing up and not talking to anyone. At the same time, the depressed guy who, when he is offered a ride anywhere he wants, chooses to go on a guided tour of a funeral parlour, is able to realize some form of awakening of identity via the female lead and leather jacket guy's heterosexual dynamic. And it all takes place in the liminal space of a squat, where the irresolute nature of the setting allows everyone to realize their identity. It's just a little drama; yes, I understand that it has greater social significance given the production context (and so few producers on this, too)---but I am just a sucker for a tight unity of theme and narrative.

It's especially remarkable how Ming-liang achieves this unity through such spare means. At parts I was reminded of a Monsieur Hulot film, just because of how funny the film is, yet with barely any dialogue. It's a very funny film and had the salle snorting, but I must admit that I took a bit of perverse pleasure when one scene moved from a comedic set-up to something quite a bit more uncomfortable. Relative to Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003), the only other film I've seen from this guy, Vive L'Amour might as well be The Bourne Identity; despite being significantly more palatable, it's nice to see his directorial style in an early, ""commercial"" form, before he settled into a market that is barely even part of the film industry. As I recall, he has begun to market his films to the artworld, rather than the cinema world.

2022-06-30,Crimes of the Future,2022,https://boxd.it/2YuwNF,,,"Highly successful, but only really enjoyable if you're into it---and I hope you aren't! The body stuff is quite unpleasant to watch, and is very familiar to us all at this point. I was unpleasantly pleased that he introduced ""eating"" as another fucked up thing that he could bring into the duology of pain and eroticism. I found myself confounded most of all by the schmaltzy dialogue. Every scene is an exposition dump, every line might as well begin with ""As you know...."" But it's all part of that Cronenberg style; funny to think of how people put Shyamalan's ""Old"" on blast for its artificial dialogue, but my countryman manages to dodge the same charge. 

There was a point early on, when the psychoanalytic themes were really piling up, that I thought it might be part of his critique of the type of people/culture he is representing; but it's a style of performance and dialogue that is present throughout all of his films. Crimes of the Future is in direct stylistic continuity with films like Videodrome and Naked Lunch: peak Cronenberg, where he has recognized what his niche is, what people expect from him, and is no longer bothering branching out with outliers like A History of Violence, A Dangerous Method, or Eastern Promises. The movie is highly successful in that its production design, pacing, atmosphere, performance, script, narrative, are all quite well unified and are all obviously the culmination of a long-running sensibility. I feel like I've seen a lot of the props before: it's really in the narrative that this film becomes something new. It's pure sci-fi, with just enough tantalizing hints at an expansive world beyond the plot (references to politics, etc). Not to mention all the plot threads that don't get tied up: I was genuinely surprised when the credits rolled.

Thematically I was reminded a lot of Nordau's ""Degeneration,"" and similar conservative reactionary thought around the onset of modernity. I'm quite sure that Nordau in particular was explicitly evoked early on as the foundation against which the film was responding. It was remarkable (problematic?) that the one black actor in the film is the one who is critical of the evolutionary ""degeneration"" that all the rest of the characters seem to embrace, to varying degrees. Because of course that is the position of the film, and of Cronenberg's entire, half-a-century long exploration of the body horror theme: of course he is critical of a culture where surgery is the new sex; where pain has become a commonplace reaction to alienation from our bodies and souls. But he's in a complicated position, where if he is unequivocally critical of his characters' ""neo-evolution,"" then he is basically a Nordauian (i.e. deeply racist) reactionary thinker. Thus, you have a black man cast judgement on everything we are watching. The problem is, that I always have the impression that this entire realm of discourse is a distinctly 20th century phenomenon, and that it does not have the same relevance today that it did when Cronenberg started making his films. He is developing a style and a theme that had greater relevance in the 70s/80s, but which no longer seems to bear entirely on the present. There are certain stylistic innovations, most notably Viggo's outfit, but the core of Cronenberg's whole oeuvre as an artist seems to me to be dated. Still successful despite that.",cinéma cineplex forum,2022-06-28

2022-07-07,Port of Shadows,1938,https://boxd.it/2ZLWyT,,,"A perfect film, and one that is certainly going in my film noir pantheon. The narrative bears a strong resemblance to Céline's <em>Journey to the End of the Night</em>, following a mysterious, acerbic military deserter as he gets embroiled in a provincial French underworld. This is classic, prototypical film noir, but with a few key differences that distinguish it from the American genre. Befitting the roiling fog of its dockside location, the cinematography is characterized by an extensive range of greys rather than a strong contrast of black and white—a look Orson Welles recognized as more properly suited to the genre's moral ambiguity, and which he used to great effect in <em>Touch of Evil</em> two decades later. Another big distinction is the humour. This film had a packed auditorium laughing consistently; I have no recollection of humour in any American film noir, certainly not from the same period.

A theme central to the film noir genre is the ever-present thread of masculinity, and it is quite interesting to compare and contrast this film's sexuality to its American counterparts. First of all—I could be wrong here—but I doubt that you would get a shot of Lauren Bacall lying naked in bed, post-coitus. You certainly would not get a side character entering the room to comedic effect, with no-one blinking an eye. Nor would you get the main character admitting that his refractory period is up as we dissolve out of him pushing his love interest down onto the bed (...maybe you would actually get something not far from this). Something else that struck me as quite unique is the main guy frankly insisting that he believes all women have a price. It is not so much that American sexuality is more prudential; I also think it's too simplistic to just say that it's the result of the Hays Code (which was, after all, a self-imposed regulation internal to the industry). Censorious policy is itself the symptom of something else. I think that American masculinity / sexuality is simply more coded, more highly regulated by complex rituals and expressions of decency than French sexuality, which is absolutely forthright. This is not to say that the end result is any different, because I don't think it is. Both societies are similarly patriarchal, similarly entrenched in rape culture and ephebophilia, etc etc. Americans are NOT prudes; they are NOT more gentle or respectful towards women when compared to the French: they are simply more coded in their designs. Make of that what you will; it's not for me to cast judgement one way or the other, although the forthrightness of the main guy here does seem less toxic than some of Bogey's more despicable turns. This is all just to say that, in the context of watching this film next to so many American films from around the same time, it provides quite an interesting (and refreshing) contrast.",cinémathèque québécoise,2022-07-05

2022-07-18,Children of Paradise,1945,https://boxd.it/320qVp,,,"This has got to be one of the most comprehensively French cultural artifacts ever created. From beginning to end, from the most basic formal elements up to the highest level of narrative theme, this film is steeped in French cultural traditions. The opening restoration notes are a perfect microcosm of just how different this film is from Anglo, German, or even Russian cinema of the same period. I've never seen anything like them before: the restorers felt the need to explicitly state that the soft focus and other touches in certain scenes were actually aesthetic decisions on the part of the filmmaker, and are definitely NOT a technical fault of the restoration process. This is just the cherry on top of the cultural milieu the film's narrative is set in, of pantomime and performance in the 19th century. 

The French cinematic tradition comes out of a much longer theatrical tradition than the American, to take an easy counterpart; even as late as 1945, you have epic mega-spectacles like this film, but who make aesthetic decisions that one might mistake for a technical flaw. You would never have a similar proviso in an American counterpart like Gone With the Wind. No restoration would need to excuse itself to the audience because American filmmaking is so rigorously formulaic (not necessarily in a pejorative sense). Films that try to attain this level of cultural touchstone are so deeply concerned with providing an utterly smooth and seamless experience for the viewer, that any outré choices made are going to be very clearly telegraphed as such.

Obviously that sort of shit is played out---I actually hate breaking the fourth wall more than anyone, possibly because my first screenplay revolved around that device---but it somehow felt completely outrageous to show that French PA, with his cig and his beret (I may be imagining that); and then to roll a note from the director, addressing the viewer, telling them to embrace a bit of childish naivete.

He stops and restarts, rehearsing the point at which he will pretend to discard his notes and speak from the heart. When we see him deliver this performance to a room full of museum benefactors, we only get a few lines of artspeak before Östlund cuts to the aftermath. Although Elisabeth Moss's character has already challenged him on his gobbledygook, establishing the film's satirical attitude toward the artworld, Bangs's incoherent reference to ""relational aesthetics"" is key to the rest of this film. Social relations are an important theme in this film, as when Moss confronts Bangs after their hookup, explicitly referring to the power afforded him by his position at the museum; or when the man with Tourette's keeps interrupting an artist talk with profanity. Rather than acknowledge how one man is inconveniencing everyone else, rendering the event null, members of the audience call for tolerance (an example of the woke mindset before it really caught on). The most obvious example of the theme of ""social relations"" is, of course, the constant presence of the homeless. They intrude into the narrative, such as it is, by interjecting themselves into the lives of our characters. They are a constant reminder of the broader social context that all these artworld shenanigans are playing out within, even as the physical geography of the film---hyper-modern Sweden---seems perfectly congruent with that social reality. Even when we visit a 7-Eleven, or a low-income housing block, they are still afflicted by the modern design that is in perfect congruity with the rest of the film's settings.

In <em>Force Majeure</em> (2014), Östlund's static, spare, and isolating compositions accentuate the alienation felt at the heart of a troubled family dynamic. In <em>The Square</em>, they are a crucial part of this film's successful representation of the artworld. Architecture and compositions are used to accentuate characters' relationships through the physical environment. Often we don't see the critical piece of action, or a key character. What I really came to appreciate about Östlund's compositions, however, is his editing: sequences are often cut short, and we are filled in at a later point on the details of what happened. There's a very careful and tightly co-ordinated integration of script, shot composition, and performance that make this possibly the best narrative film representing the artworld that I have ever seen.",laptop,2022-07-25

I liked that he doesn't really do anything particularly badass until the end of the movie, but I feel like he should have had more action scenes so that we could at least see him as some kind of martial master. The film leans into the trope of Europeans as cultured and refined as the basis for an interesting minimalist aesthetic; for the most part, narrative exposition and characters are balanced and complement the tone of the film.

Despite having more CGI animals than a Bollywood production set at the zoo, the film brings it in some cool directions. A period Predator film was only a matter of time, and I hope we get more, in particular a pirate one.

Most important thing about the movie is the new direction it takes the predator. This member of the species is more horrifying than the predator has been in a long time (at one point, it bathes in blood). The monster killing animals seems like an extremely lame thing for it to do, but I think it was important narratively to demonstrate that this is the ""first"" predator (didn't know there was bigger game, in the form of humans). It also helps establish the alien as unreasonably vicious in its battles with wolves and bears, which it must know are completely outmatched. This senseless viciousness is key to the idea of the predator as a monster, a cinematic genre element that has been somewhat lost since (maybe) the original.",tv,2022-08-08

Set among the criminal underworld, yes, but inadvertently valorizes its deplorable characters by presenting them as noble heroes. The male lead, played by Robert Taylor as an aristocratic, genteel dandy, is also an unrepentant lawyer to the mob. Not only does his virtuous behaviour toward Cyd Charisse, the titular party girl, provoke our desire to identify with what are very simply the socially correct moral values of 50s America---but the narrative arc of his disability provokes our sympathy. The correlation this film makes between its social milieu and the admirable traits Taylor embodies misses the point of what film noir is intended to do. The best noir features characters who are trapped by their circumstances; who are in some way likeable, but who are driven to anti-social behaviour by the set of social institutions that confine them.

the story here is quite weak. everything about it is transparently fake. main guy has a terminal ""blood illness"" that motivates him to follow the plot? sure. his family is SO fucking fake, with the utter non-character of his wife and kid. it's clear that these are just backstory, necessary to create the illusion of a world or whatever---but i just wish that the film leaned in a bit into the absurdity of its plot contrivances, as well as its narrative blindspots, rather than trying to maintain some illusion of ""reality.""

another thing i realized while watching this: in pretty much all european films from this period, there are shots of cityscapes, construction, cranes, skyscrapers, etc etc. godard will use the sounds of modernity, antonioni, fassbinder, blahblahblah. i always wondered about it, trying to find some parallel between the images of building and finance and urbanism, and the narratives of the modern new wave. i realized that, whatever direct parallels you might find---this film takes place in post-war germany, there is a strong presence of SPD graffiti, so all the cities and cranes do take on a literal meaning---but more importantly, i think that is just what was happening in the cities of the time, and the filmmakers were just recording what was happening around them. a document of a passed time; a bit of ""visual culture,"" if you will.",tv,2022-09-11

2023-01-25,To Have and Have Not,1944,https://boxd.it/3L8uqB,,Yes,"the night out sequence is as great an example of narrative realism as i can think of. what's so important about it is how the scene is prolonged: first they are hanging out in the hotel lobby; then the shoot-out happens; then they are taken to the cop shop; then they stop in at a bar on the way back to the hotel. bogie leaves, then bacall re-joins him in his room with a bottle (possibly the sexiest gesture i have ever seen in a movie). that's about three natural ending points to the sequence already; but then they move back and forth, across the hall, between rooms, like three times?

realism in film emphasizes filmic techniques like long takes and deep focus, but this narrative technique (not at all limited to film) of prolonging a scene is a very important realist technique that i haven't really seen mentioned much. it's definitely going into my book of poetic techniques. the point is that you push the characters outside of their natural boundaries; the writer is forced to dig deeper, deeper into the character to uncover whatever truth is contained in the scene.

other examples that came to mind include the scene in My Struggle 1 when knausgaard and his brother need to continually interrogate their grandmother to find the truth of what happened to their father; and so many godard scenes.

the final shot of this film emphasizes what's going on here, too. we see the backs of the two characters as they walk OUT of the scene, out of the setting; we don't linger long, just enough to see them disappear and be left with a martinique thrown to fend for itself after the fun of the adventuring americans has come to an end.",fmst 315,2023-01-23

i heard from another (unverified) source that coppola decided to erase the central black character of the novel from her adaptation because ""little girls watch her films,"" and she didn't want to depict a black slave---which is an idea i can get behind, but i don't think the palpable void at the centre of this film was intentionally integrated into its structure. for example, i don't think the little girls coppola caters to will be able to pick up on how much the invisible presence of slavery informs what is happening onscreen. in my assessment, this film is illustrative as a failure; it was unethical to produce, and should probably be kept away from its target audience.",tv,2023-01-31

it's a beautiful film, no doubt. very successful. one of his most straightforward and compelling films from this half of his career. with avant-garde artists, i will sometimes forget that there is (generally) a deep mastery of craft underlying the style. one might think that godard is incapable of making a ""normal"" movie. but there is no doubt here that he was in command of the medium from the earliest years and could make a narrative feature without all the weird digressions. he could even do it while integrating a few formal tricks that do an excellent job heightening the emotionality of the film.

2023-03-30,Theorem,1968,https://boxd.it/436JBx,,Yes,"What struck me watching this film compared to recent Godard films is how good Pasolini is with drama, theme, and formal beauty. There's not much plot here, but the drama is excellently done. The characters all make sense, even as they're cut-outs—and it has a lot to do with the excellent performances, which is not to be taken for granted in the Euro arthouse. I imagine that Anne Wiazemsky was looking for a director who had a serious character for her, and an understanding of drama those French guys did not.

This movie benefits from its structure, which is really well chosen. It works for Pasolini the filmmaker, the dramaturg, and the cultural theorist to set up a compact set of systems. There's the visual system (the different colour tones and camera setups), the dramatic system (the guy fucks everyone and they have religious experiences), and the thematic system. Religion, art, horror. It's all very compact, economical, and synthesized well with the overall spare beauty of the image.

What I wonder about is Pasolini's relevance. I am definitely conflating his general relevance, and his relevance for me. I think his centenary passed recently, so his films did pass through the circuit...but I'm not sure he has the relevance he did when I was coming up as a film snob. 

This movie was very central to my picture of modernist cinema when I first saw it. I appreciate how excellently made this film is: it's a tight package, like Terence Stamp's ass. But I'm not sure I love it anymore.","fmst 315, va",2023-03-27

2023-03-30,John Wick: Chapter 4,2023,https://boxd.it/4388Oj,,,"john wick is on the cutting edge of modern american liberal masculinity. the first level of this is keanu reeves himself: a ""dreamy"" star, a ""stoner"" star, a comedic straightman who has been performing the symbolic emasculation of the pratfall for decades. he's masculine, but non-threatening. the franchise is filled with signifiers that associate a progressive tendency with an edgy masculinity: the psychobilly phone operators; the gay-coded Concierge and Manager; the mute nonbinary character from John Wick 3; the blind guy in this one. at the outset of the Osaka Hotel scene, Sanada's character begrudgingly accepts the ""therapy dog,"" and the script even repeats the phrase three times. the concept of a therapy dog is played entirely straight: the humour of that scene comes from the spectacle of an older patriarch accepting what is very clearly a term of youth culture (""therapy dog""), while acknowledging that his acceptance is itself incongruous.

what do the aesthetics of this franchise portend? it is not to say that the high proportion of differently-abled characters (for example) in this series is good or bad. rather, we can surmise based on its popularity that the franchise articulates a vision of masculinity that is meeting its target demographic's demand. it's progressive, and youngsters want their media to reflect their progressive (liberal) ideology. that's fine. my own experience of this film as a straight, cis, white, able-bodied man was one of enjoyment. not complete adulation like a lot of people seem to be giving it: it's a technical film, and technique, while fine in and of itself, does not make art. but if i compare this to other examples of progressive liberal feminism (any expression of masculinity, to be clear, is simultaneously a feminism) in a similar genre---say, any of the Marvel or Star Wars films---the john wick franchise is trying to break free from the death-spiral the ideologues over at Disney are locked in. i trust my instincts and my instincts tell me that the keanu reeves-brand male is healthier than the men in the MCU. the edginess is well-balanced with the progressivism, and the unpretentious brand of the franchise effectively nullifies its own stakes (not that your shit can get by me, mfer).",cinéma banque scotia,2023-03-28

2023-05-02,The Love Witch,2016,https://boxd.it/4c0Dqn,,Yes,"outsider art (in my understanding) has both a productive dimension, and an aesthetic dimension. in terms of production, outsider art is usually produced and published outside of the artworld. The Room was independently produced and independently distributed by the film's author in rented theatres. independence from the artworld may be a necessary condition for ""outsider art,"" but it is not sufficient given that independent cinema has been around forever (the arthouse is just another part of the filmworld). the key is that most independent productions, inept as they may be, are designed according to the standards of the institution they are not a part of. most b-movies try to replicate popular film structures; often, a filmmaker will make a movie ""outside"" the filmworld as a means to enter into it, as in the case of Evil Dead (and countless other examples). however, these films do not provoke the same sensations as canonical example of outsider cinema like The Room, The Evil Within, and the films of neil breen. it is not just that daniel johnston independently produced and distributed his recordings: the music itself is unlike anything that anyone who is immersed in the music industry would have been capable of producing without design.

The Love Witch has stuck in my mind from when i saw it years ago. i included it in my list of <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/theinvertedform/list/outsider-cinema/"">outsider cinema</a>, but wanted to re-watch to see if my initial impression of it held.

Biller, who has an MFA from CalArts, wrote, directed, produced, edited, and did all the music, costumes, and sets for The Love Witch. pre-production was a years-long process during which she individually hand-sewed the film's many ornate and varied costumes. that level of independent auteurship is not conventional in industrial filmmaking, and is already a sign that this movie fits the first criteria of being a film made outside the structure of the filmworld. typically financing comes from a studio or some other backer normally given a credit. in this case, i haven't found a record of where specifically the money came from (to shoot on 35mm! to hire an expert reproduction cinematographer!). all of this indicates that the film was produced ""outside"" of the film industry, 

but financing and assemblage are only half of the production of a film. the other half is distribution. The Room is ""true"" outsider art in that it was independently distributed as well as produced, using the live performance element of the theatre to build a cult. this film was submitted to festivals, purchased by a distributor, given a limited theatrical release, nominated for awards, and has a lively critical and audience reception. it was served to the filmworld, and the filmworld ate it up. but The Love Witch has a very deliberate style that creates an aesthetic parallel with The Room's uncanniness.

The Room is very funny in its ineptitude, but it's also kind of creepy. it resembles a conventional melodrama, but every beat is slightly askew. that close synchronicity of resemblance and difference has a disturbing effect. it's in the performances and dialogue, but The Room's genius is integrating a subtly-perceptible incomprehensibility into the visual elements of cinema. the famous rooftop sequence, shot on a rooftop with green screens. The Love Witch tries to replicate the same kind of arbitrariness as The Room: one scene in particular took me out of it: when the cop character is having a conversation with his partner, but then goes on to order a sandwich in extensive detail. it becomes obvious that the film is being ""intentionally bad."" Wiseau's dialogue is 100% un-self-conscious. like daniel johnston, it is a truly ""naive"" expression, whereas The Love Witch is ""cynical"" in the sense of being deliberate.

that is a lot of work to say something probably obvious to most people on watching the film. and yet, i have found that in The Love Witch, something more complicated arises than its parts might suggest. something that i haven't seen discussed in any of the critical discourse. for the bulk of the film, i found its ""badness"" to be quite convincing. Biller is very good at reproducing the throwback style of the visually-opulent technicolour melodramas of the 50s and 60s. the performance style, resting on the singular Samantha Robinson, but very well supported by the rest of the cast, is key to the film. the unity of narrative theme and multi-layered, historically-informed film style could only have been developed by someone trained in an MFA---but with the liberty of a completely independently-authored production.

we can think of the performance style and the corny dialogue as part of the throwback aesthetic. working backwards from The Love Witch, the hypothesis would be that the films Biller is referencing had similar cinematic malapropisms, and that's why she chose to include dumb shit in the film. it's a testament to the scriptwriting that i found it on the whole to be very convincing. but what i have not seen discussed is the significance of the generic--formal parallel between the melodrama, a genre of ""women's cinema"" and therefore an undercurrent of the cinematic canon. a place for outsiders. The Room is also a melodrama, but it is unlikely that Wiseau knew enough about film history to know to include fake-sounding dialogue and nonsensical eddies in his dramaturgy (plus, we would be able to detect such design).

i don't know enough about the genre Biller is referencing, so i can't say whether those films would be called ""outsider art,"" but i suspect not. we can't call The Love Witch outsider art, because it is fully part of the filmworld. part of that is because every aspect of it is intentionally designed: there's nothing naive about it. at the same time, it is trying to recreate something that resembles the familiar, but which is authentically inept, or informed by an incomprehensible vision. ""true"" naive films like The Room, The Evil Within, and the films of neil breen are successful in building an aesthetic that is at once familiar, but also completely unfamiliar. there's nothing like any of those films. 

should we just call The Love Witch ""fake outsider art""? i have other examples in mind of films that simulate naivety in their pursuit of a specific project, and which circulate within the filmworld. we need something we can use to refer to the aesthetic core of outsider art. films like The Matrix Resurrections, Floating Clouds, and On the Beach at Night Alone all have something in common with The Room. the term i propose for this is <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/theinvertedform/list/the-naive-uncanny/"">THE NAIVE UNCANNY</a>!",tv,2023-04-28

2023-05-05,Claire's Camera,2017,https://boxd.it/4cPOxB,,,"hong sangsoo is like ingmar bergman but for the digital age. his films are character-focused, the ""plots"" and ""stories"" all different permutations of a few basic dramatic elements that have evolved over his career. but his principle interest, like bergman, is drama and character. the major difference between the two is that the dour swede tends to have more ""epic"" and high-concept narratives. period films; films about priests reckoning with faith; films about dynastic turbulence, that sort of thing. bergman also has a strong modernist tendency towards formalism. it's not always there, many of his best films (imo) are made in a ""transparent"" style, but i would be completely shocked to see hong direct a sequence as abstract as the opening of Persona, for example.

hong's principle focus is drama, but i am very strongly drawn to the formal elements of his style. i am interested in the technological mediation of culture, and in mass culture generally. hong's films are ""mass"" films, ""proletarian"" films in virtue of being deeply humanist. they represent a new approach to realism that is categorically different from 20th century cinematic realism. 

when claire asks man-hee what her favourite things about korea are, she mentions food and friends. she could have added booze and it would have been a list of hong's favourite things to show onscreen: universal cultural touchpoints. the minor dramas and the activities depicted onscreen are all universal, shot in the most universal style imaginable. it's minimalist, but it comes from the opposite place of bergman's modernism.

what are the key elements of hong's visual style? most famously, the zoom; the long takes; and for me, the digital video. both are signififers of a vernacular (mass, proletariat, folkway) moving image culture. during the scene where the director is celebrating his 50th birthday by getting drunk with the boss, there is a moment where he leans forward over the table. the camera responds instantly by zooming in to give us a closer frame of the two. it's as though the camera operator happened to be there to capture the drama, and is responding in the same ad hoc, impromptu way that amateur videographers do to a changing composition. hong is known for doing many takes; his shots are clearly very carefully composed in order to achieve the balance that his films have. that doesn't happen by accident, but the zoom and the digital video, both signifiers of amateurism, make it seem as though they do.

that is why i say hong sangsoo is the ingmar bergman of the digital age. his films are about universal themes, universal dramas, just like bergman's films. the difference is that hong developed a formal style that emerges out of a mass moving image culture that did not exist when bergman was making movies. that style only arose in the 90s (at the earliest), following the mass production of digital cameras. the zoom and the specific look of digital images are both associated with amateur (or mass, or folk, or proletarian) moving image cultures because the mass production of camcorders, and the development of distribution networks, are what allowed that culture to come into being. 

it might be quite strange to say that hong is a proletarian filmmaker, since his characters and milieux tend to be bourgeois; it might be strange to emphasize the formal style of a director who is most associated with low-budget economism, but these are the elements of his oeuvre that grab me. hong is really on the cutting edge of something, pushing realism in a direction that is categorically different from anything achieved in the 20th century Euro arthouse canon (aside from outliers like godard). despite the innocuous nature of his films, he is doing quite a lot for the medium.",tv,2023-05-03
