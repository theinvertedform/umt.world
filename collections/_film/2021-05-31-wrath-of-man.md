pretty funny watching this the day after Eyes Wide Shut: the latter intentionally uses uncanny performances for the explicit purpose of creating a dream-like atmosphere, whereas this film has uncannily bad, unnatural performances, but i can't see how they fit into the overall structure of the film. 

all the heists and action were pretty well executed though (obviously).
