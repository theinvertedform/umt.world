At first I thought it was a piece of "outsider art," but after a bit I settled into viewing it as just a very dated film with some fairly complex social significance. Not very good, but interesting, and has a pretty disorienting overall aesthetic. It's still just a bit too polished and intentional to really qualify as "outsider."

It did make me realize that all the music I loved as a teenager was pretty lesbian.
