in the american version of this film, the bad guy is handcuffed to a pipe and the good guy applies a blowtorch to him until he surrenders the information...basically the movie Prisoners.

i found this in a list by Criterion of "80s horror," but i have to say the predominant genre of this film is a pretty even fight between "suspense/thriller" and "comedy."
