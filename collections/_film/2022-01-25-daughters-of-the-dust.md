i loved the production design, minimal as it is; and this film has beautiful photography by arthur jafa. an important film, but not really a pleasurable experience for me personally, being a black women's film. i read an old village voice article on its production that compared dash's first feature to bresson, specifically at the level of performance. supporting this is a quote where she says she is a technical director, rather than an actor's director. the performances in this film are not bressonian by any means. i wonder if she just kinda let the actors do their own thing.
