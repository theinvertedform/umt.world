very strangely, this didn't hit for me. i know i'm dumb but i was kinda surprised to find the plot slightly difficult to follow at times. the characters were quite good, but the comedy was either lacking some timing, or the machine-generated subs i was watching threw it off for me. the action was not very exciting, either. i dug the philosophy bits toward the beginning, and i liked the consistent theme of coincidence, but despite a lot of great elements (prime among them being mads, my new favourite actor) it didn't really come together. i feel bad for saying this...
