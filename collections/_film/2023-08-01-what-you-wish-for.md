like The Passenger meets The Menu, with a fun schlocky premise. themes as equal part Camus as "eat the rich." i wish the detective had been more of a character. he seemed like a goofy guy who was maybe in on the game, but in the end his behaviour amounts to nothing. he doesn't have a voice in the narrative and his motivations are not rounded out. it would have added to the tension of the dinner scenes if we knew more about him. other than this, the cast does a great job of conveying an intriguing ambiguity. the film is overall a good tonal balance between arch and serious.
