lots of good to say about this, but ultimately it's quite boring and lacks any excitement. good concept, well structured, the writing is good in general; i loved a lot of the production design and camera work; the music is really lacking, and there were a few moments that i feel would have played a lot better in a carpenter film, just because there would have been better music. ultimately i have to conclude that there just was no budget to do any cool scares, because they were clearly trying to do something.
