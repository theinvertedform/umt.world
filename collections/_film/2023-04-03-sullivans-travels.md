this movie is basically evil, with a very shitty script that manages to botch a perfectly good premise; maudlin montages; an exploitative narrative that absolutely fails to be self critical or pull off any kind of reversal. the filmmaking is nothing special. the lead guy's performance sucks. the only good part is when veronica Lake is onscreen; the rest of the time, we are subjected to a bunch of bullshit about how great Hollywood is (even as it openly admits it's incapacity to do other than maintain the liberal order).
