sadly can't say i liked it. this is just a basic, generic, spanish-produced movie. no idea why criterion is distributing it, no idea why it's playing at the DIY underground movie night. the film plays for laughs, but none of the humour hit for me (too old, from too far away?). i really liked the scene where the husband pretends to be a dog, and ofc the main lady's performance is great, much more alive than other european films...but visually, formally, there is nothing special about this. the only "signature" visual element of this film is the location and some production touches: nice costumes, nice furniture, etc. nothing stylish apart from that. this is just a spanish midlist movie. you can tell because the "themes" are also extremely basic. i couldn't help rolling my eyes at the guy going from entering numbers into his weird computer, to looking at the ants in the box.
