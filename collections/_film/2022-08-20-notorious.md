i recall that i watched this once, a long time ago. this time around, i felt like the great master's technique was charmingly on display. this is very much a performance film: probably the most impressed i've been by cary grant, and ingrid bergman was on a whole other level. some of her line readings are intense like you get in contemporary films, unhinged and completely unlike what i associate with films of this era.
