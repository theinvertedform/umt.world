i thought it was quite astonishing the path this film took. very unexpected and very powerful storytelling through such economical means. a very revolutionary film that we have scorsese to thank for, LOL!! the restoration looks incredible.

i'm not sure where to put this movie. it doesn't quite fit with new wave-style films like Touki Bouki or Black Girl. it doesn't quite fit with "world cinema" like Yeelen; neither is it as formally militant as latin american third cinema. it reminded me, in a way, of the single mikio naruse film i've seen. women's cinema. the emphasis is on storytelling and emotion. idk, not much intelligent to say about this movie, other than that i loved it!!
