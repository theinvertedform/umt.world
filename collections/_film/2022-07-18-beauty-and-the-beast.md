Pure movie magic. Beast makeup looks great; the special effects are so charming and effective. In keeping with my last review of Les enfants du paradis, a lot of my attention is focused on certain production details clustered right at the beginning of the film: the handwritten credits, in an idiosyncratic and utterly charming cursive; and the brief inclusion of the guy snapping the clapper before Cocteau's note to the viewer rolls. Obviously that sort of shit is played out---I actually hate breaking the fourth wall more than anyone, possibly because my first screenplay revolved around that device---but it somehow felt completely outrageous to show that French PA, with his cig and his beret (I may be imagining that); and then to roll a note from the director, addressing the viewer, telling them to embrace a bit of childish naivete. A perfect counterpart to the end of the film, with Beauty and the Beast lifted upwards into the rolling smoke. Movie magic!!!
