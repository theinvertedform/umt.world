on a whim i thought i would go through my downloads directory in alphabetical order. wasn't really prepared for this. loved the exposition-less narrative development in the first two acts, following seemingly unrelated, intersecting characters, expecting violence but not entirely prepared from whence. loved the abrupt movement to the third act, skipping all the courtroom drama and thereby minimizing the role of the lawyer. in the end, all he gets is to witness and know his failure: he is not allowed the salvation of having his apparently brilliant defense recorded for posterity.

and of course the photography...wow...the vignetting, the colour grading, the sound design. certain scenes kinda reminded me of the disgusting german film Angst, but this is a lot more aesthetically mature (obv).
