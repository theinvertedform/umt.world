dropped half a tab of acid before seeing the HFR 3D version. i saw the star wars sequel trilogy similarly high on psychedelics, because if i am going to submit myself to such a spectacle, then it feels as though i need to peel my psychic defenses away in order to be able to more adequately stare into the dark heart of empire. i was on such high guard, but as it turns out this movie is not my / our enemy---unlike literally every piece of blockbuster american culture. this film is actually on our side, to some degree, and whatever that may mean.

i'm rooting hard for this film. it's so healthy compared to the alternatives: top gun, star wars, the latest marvel drek, which are unequivocally trying to kill us in the same way mcdonald's is. this movie is good. it's good. it's positive. it's healthy. it's a breath of fresh air, a splash of cool water.
