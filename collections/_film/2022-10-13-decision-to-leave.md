saw this with french subs after volunteering at the FNC. packed theatre. enjoyed it a lot more on the second viewing---i'm quite sure the copy i downloaded had shitty sound and colour grading. lots of visual craft in this, with basically every scene transitioning to the next through some use of match on action or graphic match. very fly outfits. the music is what reminds me the most of hitchcock; that, and the psycho-sexual drama. it is possible that the plot is a bit too convoluted for its own good, but overall this is a very nice, restrained bit of craft.
