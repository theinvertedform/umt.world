had a couple quite creepy moments...i liked all the use of grainy video footage and the representations of photographic editing. a pretty cool plot hook that gets revealed in the second half that opens up the ending of the film to ambiguity...but i also thought this film was strangely emotionless. i thought it might be the characters reacting to the twist that occurs halfway through, but i suspect it's more to do with direction.
