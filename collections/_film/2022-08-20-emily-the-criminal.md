i was very happy to watch this on a sunday afternoon. a gripping dramatic crime thriller; the film negates the political content of the narrative in order to succeed as entertainment. class injustice is represented, but instead of a political response, the film only represents the typical american response to political demands, which is to commodify discontent. a great physical performance from aubrey plaza.
