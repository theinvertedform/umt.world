this movie is good for the first two acts, but really falls apart when it becomes a disgustingly schmaltzy schlockfest. the post-ironic media hipster, whose references and whose understanding of contemporary society are all "cutting edge," is effectively lampooned by placing him in the middle of a sincere narrative. however, the script leans so heavily on formula, to me it reveals its hand as cynically motivated. whatever investigation on the part of the writer that went into developing this story was not carried through to the end; it fails to find a "negation of the negation," as robert mckee would say. instead, i can only surmise that the narrative hook, which is the main character, was selected because he represented an alluring angle for the audience to project themselves onto.

not very well said, i realize, but the idea is that this film is pretty decent, but falls apart because it's merely a piece of commercially-oriented craft, and does not have any deeper understanding of its own themes to resolve the third act...despite all of its pretensions.
