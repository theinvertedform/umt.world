not very good. weirdly, i thought that the idris elba character and the doctor character were reversed: many contemporary films are happy to depict the american military as being unsympathetic and money-hungry. i thought that a contemporary version of this film would have had him want to preserve the two kids in order to make some vaccine and make a bunch of money, while the doctor character would more realistically be interested in clamping down on spread of the virus.
