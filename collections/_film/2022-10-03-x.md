i hate to put all the blame on this film, but whatever "homage" aesthetic this film is using has officially jumped the shark. sorry, but it's gone too far. if the core of your film is just a series of elements lifted from other films, you can no longer get around this fact. this film is part of a tradition of post-hipster sincerity that tried to get over cultural irony poisoning by embracing its history, and it's not that it does anything particularly bad---it just feels too much. this style of cinema has peaked.
