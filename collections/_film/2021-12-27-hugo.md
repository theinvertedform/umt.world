too grown up for kids, but the kids are too young for this to be a proper YA story. not really sure who this is for. liked the theme of trauma that connected all the characters. i also really liked all the film history stuff, and even though it's not clear to me what age range the film is for, i still like the idea of kids being exposed to film history.
