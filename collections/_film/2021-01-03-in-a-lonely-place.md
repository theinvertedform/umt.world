bleak, black, nihilistic AF. really liked the ending. really loved the performances from bogey and gloria grahame. i liked the story quite a bit too, and the macguffin murder plot that concealed the main story, which is just a romance.

i thought that bogey's character was perhaps slightly unrealistically paranoid and perceptive; he seemed to know what was going on a bit early. but his character was really cool.
