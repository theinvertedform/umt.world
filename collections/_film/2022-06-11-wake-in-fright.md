the horror of this film is just australians in their natural habitat. a very effective presentation of mundanity in such a way that there is a constant sense of dis-articulated tension. also love how the main guy's relationship with alcohol changes---by the third day, he's sucking it down like his life depends on it. very strange relationship to women: one line of poetry, and the single lady character leads him off to lay down in the dust.

side note, this is the first movie i watched on my tv with my new (used) yamaha yas-209 soundbar. i previously had a pair of logitech PC speakers that i bought for $30 about 6 years ago, and which were failing to the point of being pretty much unusable. there's some slight tearing on the video, presumably because the pi i use to watch movies is now outputting two hdmi streams. the sound experience is not mind blowing surround sound, but it's really nice to just be able to hear things clearly. this movie is all drunk aussies yammering inarticulately, so in a way, a really good test of the speaker's ability to clearly project sound. a huge upgrade. hoping to get a 4K tv this summer that i can connect the soundbar to directly, which will hopefully resolve the screen tearing & allow me to (finally) get a bluray player and start watching/collecting some physical media.
