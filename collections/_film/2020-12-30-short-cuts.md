insanely good. avengers and other big, ensemble action films that try to juggle a dozen characters should take lessons from this. seems like it would have been great fun / a great challenge to edit this. altman's camerawork (drifting, moving around) is so damn good, really fits the subject here, and absolutely iconic. really funny, but also lots of extremely dark parts--sometimes both at once. the best example being the shouting match between julianne moore's character and her husband, where she reveals that she cheated on him at a party three years prior. the dialogue is so good, the performances are all so good--there are real laughs in the middle of this extremely serious, dark, dramatic moment.
