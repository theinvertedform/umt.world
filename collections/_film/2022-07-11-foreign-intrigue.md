this has got to be one of the worst shot movies i've seen in a long time. 90% of the shots of mitchum are low angle, to the extent that i started to feel like the director was getting off on his star power. it winds up with some hilariously bad framing, where you have a secondary character's head cut in half by the bottom of the image. there's some quite annoying camera movement too that stuck out at me. very amateurish by producer-writer-director sheldon reynolds. the climax is deeply sappy, the sets don't take advantage of the location, the plot is boring...just all around not a good film.
