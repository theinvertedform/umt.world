This film is easily recognizable visually as a streaming feature, sad to say, because I am a fan of the Predator franchise. Despite having more CGI animals than a Bollywood production set at the zoo, the film brings it in some cool directions. A period Predator film was only a matter of time, and I hope we get more, in particular a pirate one.

Most important thing about the movie is the new direction it takes the predator. This member of the species is more horrifying than the predator has been in a long time (at one point, it bathes in blood). The monster killing animals seems like an extremely lame thing for it to do, but I think it was important narratively to demonstrate that this is the "first" predator (didn't know there was bigger game, in the form of humans). It also helps establish the alien as unreasonably vicious in its battles with wolves and bears, which it must know are completely outmatched. This senseless viciousness is key to the idea of the predator as a monster, a cinematic genre element that has been somewhat lost since (maybe) the original.
