so many of paul mccartney's songs have a major shift, or are medleys, because of laziness---too impatient to write an ending. the hardest thing to do is see a project through to a proper conclusion. the last two movies by this guy had what i found to be unsatisfying, concept-based narrative pivots in the second half. this movie, by contrast, sticks the landing.
