a very complex and layered historical representation of Black culture. i'll be taking parenting lessons from this. sexuality and masculinity stuck out as a dominant theme, and also run through My Brother's Wedding. trying to think about this and tina campt's ideas about a "politics of refusal." also trying to think about the LA Rebellion's project to develop a new Black aesthetics. central to this film's contribution was the narrative focus on the representation of a wider community instead of emphasizing an individual narrative.
