"we don't cater to your class of people" (all rich people go to heaven).

this film has a fairly progressive position on gender politics and hetero dynamics. it's to be expected from lubitsch, but still consistently surprising how ahead of his time he was. the comedic tone kind of subverted the melodramatic basis, which i think make the film more palatable to men and not a strict piece of "women's cinema," as melodrama is so often understood to be.
