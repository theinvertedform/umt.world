2020-10-01,Feels Good Man,2020,https://boxd.it/1nEmZP,2.5,,"A sequel to TFW No GF, but from the perspective of the opposite side--the normie Matt Furie, who gets drawn into incel-land. Tries to get philosophical when one of the guests begins talking about ""meme magic,"" and explains a bit of the cosmology of Kek. Many of the guests have pedigree, at least compared to the guests from TFW No GF.

The problem is that the explorations are not satisfyingly deep, and a narrative is imposed with a somewhat heavy hand on the documentary material. Additionally, the film lacks a satisfying conclusion to the character arc. The open-endedness of the future of Pepe was a strong aspect of the film, but the cast of characters is not as interesting to me as those in TFW No GF.",,2020-09-30
2020-10-01,Flirting with Disaster,1996,https://boxd.it/1nEnxn,2,,"A little rom-com that I watched in the background while doing some coding. I liked Ben Stiller's high-waisted, pleated wool pants, and the oversized shirt tucked into them--very 90s, very cool. I liked Patricia Arquette's mom look, and Josh Brolin was great. Also really loved the second son of the main character's parents, in the final section of the movie.",,2020-09-30
2020-10-01,Notting Hill,1999,https://boxd.it/1nEof5,2,,"This film almost said something deep about the nature of love, but in the end didn't quite manage to say anything meaningful. Maybe I only thought it got close to saying something deep because it was affecting, and made me remember some of those supercharged moments when you meet someone, and I want it to justify itself.",,2020-09-29
2020-10-01,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,2011,https://boxd.it/1nErEx,2.5,,"Bon look, not great for watching in the background. Too much plot, but it was easy to understand at the end by assuming that ""the craziest thing"" had to happen, because it's a highly crafted spy movie. Lots of men, bald and otherwise, and British unhealthiness.",,2020-09-29
2020-10-01,The Silence,1963,https://boxd.it/1nEsE9,,,"Better than Persona. Political, too--rare for Bergman.",,
2020-10-02,Mission: Impossible - Fallout,2018,https://boxd.it/1nLrP5,,,"Mission Impossible films are truly about nothing. Pure spectacle, the plots are an echo from the time period of the first film. A cabal of ""anarchists"" with no greater motivation than to destroy, and who use a nuclear bomb, no less? It's from another period of history, and is completely devoid of any subtext that makes the film ""about"" something more than its plot. 

The chase scenes through Paris were pretty cool, as was the first fight scene in the washroom.",,2020-10-01
