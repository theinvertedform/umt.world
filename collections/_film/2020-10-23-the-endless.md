this, and its sequel, were so fucking bad. immature garbage. my constant thought throughout this film as well as Resolution was how IMMATURE it is to make this type of extremely meta film. absolute trash. made me want to revisit Funny Games, though, and see how it is able to use a similar gimmick but to a much greater effect.

ultimately, this shit is just so goddamn immature, pure masturbatory garbage, pure trash, i hated this film and resolution.
