ok this one was always my favourite growing up. i think that somehow, by the time i was old enough to operate the VCR on my own, it was the only tape of the original trilogy we had left. i still think it has the best action sequences, and the reveal of the emperor is extremely epic. it also takes more time to breathe. whereas the first two films are constantly moving at 100% top speed. luke is much more grown up (traumatized) in this one. despite all these relative strengths, it is not quite as strong as the previous two films, unfortunately.
