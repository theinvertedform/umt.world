fell for the chapo hype. haven't seen this since it first came out. it was about as good and also about as cheesy as i remember. sure, the anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist and anti-american themes are real, but it's still essentially a hollywood film and still works within that paradigm. to truly be "revolutionary," to truly have political potential, even, i think it would have to incorporate some brechtian alienation effects and that's really the opposite of what it does, with the next-level VFX.

the effects look really nice, i will say. they haven't aged much, and they are just incredibly detailed and well-rendered. it's a decent film, worth re-watching, though i prefer T2 any day.
