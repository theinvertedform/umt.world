the obfuscation of the bad guy through editing gets a bit tedious, but the film holds up remarkably well overall. 

danny really is a great stylist, with great taste and an excellent sense of what works and what doesn't. the script is quite good too, with plenty of intriguing concepts and plot machinations; there are a few nitpicks to be had with both the direction and the writing---the editing around the bad guy gets a bit tedious; the religious mania isn't given any context---but alex and danny are in top form here. (not quite as good as The Beach, which i have a special fondness for; or 28 Days Later, one of the greatest horror films ever made.)
