my favourite style of film: stuffy, mannered, talky horror set in british drawing rooms, with uptight characters confronted by supernatural phenomena that they cannot explain. like an adaptation of carnacki the ghost finder. i love how boring it is but...kinda wish that it was somehow like 25% more visually interesting. needed a bit of spice.
