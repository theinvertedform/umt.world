i was crying a lot at the end, but then immediately got pissed at meryl streep's character's ridiculous about-face. it made me think of that theory of breaking-up where you are supposed to make the person so pissed off that they are less heartbroken.

i get the decision to do it, and i think it does logically follow from the characters--but i also hate it, and wish they had figured out something better to do. i recently read robert mckee's "story" which uses this as an example of great scriptwriting. it is, but i also wish they had found some better solution.
