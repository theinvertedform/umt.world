is this what romanian cinema is like? really quite strange, but also an appropriate representation of the alienation of the pandemic age. especially in terms of sound, it really brought me back to my experience of (eastern) europe: the constant grinding buzz of shitty diesel motors. on top of that, you have the sound of phones and ringtones and people exclaiming constantly in the mix. combined with the realism and verite quality of the first segments, which are just long scenes of the main character walking around a city, with long shots of the urban landscape and the occasional pedestrian swearing into the camera, i think the film did a pretty good job of blurring the line between fiction and reality---even with the highly stylized structure of the film. last song was really good. other people don't seem to like it, but i thought this was a quite apt picture of both the alienation and the hostility of modernity. everyone wearing a mask---brilliant. a really good pandemic film.
