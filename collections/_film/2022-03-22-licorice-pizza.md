extremely bizarre movie. hard to know what to make of it. pretty fun overall. both the two leads seemed to be playing anachronistic character types (self-knowing bimbo is definitely a contemporary phenomenon). the big truck action scene kinda had a similar tension to Boogie Nights. i wonder if modern auteurs are leaning into ambiguity and morally-grey stories in reaction to the bland hypermoralism of contemporary filmmaking (thinking of Red Rocket too).
