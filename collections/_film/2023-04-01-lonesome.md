a very interesting historical document. i think i can see why this was fascinating enough for benjamin to write about it in a letter to adorno. it has a high number of technical innovations, but the partial use of sound make this film a bridge between two worlds. the sound pierces through the form of the silent film: it's quite a stunning effect.

the narrative on this one is very sweet and i loved it quite a lot (being a sap). its images give a detailed ethnography of city life and modern alienation, all very relatable.
