liberal men don't like this film because it is QUEER which is fundamentally against the strictly quantitative form of reasoning that is all liberals are capable of. male woke warriors don't like this film because they don't want to go on a narrative arc and experience true empathy: they are stuck in the first phase of nick miller's arc, where they can hear what the women want and simply regurgitate it back at them. they are not capable of putting themselves in the shoes of a woman, and fully internalizing what women want, because to do so they would have to experience the schizophrenic break that mel gibson does when he is stumbling around his apartment, smoking and drinking and muttering to himself like a bum on the corner; painting his nails, putting on nylons, and LEARNING about WHAT WOMEN WANT---that is the future liberal men are afraid of because it is definitively queer and cannot be reconciled in the terms of quantitative reasoning.
