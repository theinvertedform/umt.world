watched this randomly off of a DVD compilation of shorts from the LA Rebellion. doggerel, nothing more than an exercise. made by a student, categorized as part of a historically-significant film movement, published as part of a retrospective anthology, acquired by my university, watched by a student (me). the great circlejerk of academic life.
