the concept is very uncanny, but i just wish the antagonist hadn't fallen into such an easily recognizable type. this film is missing some weird horror: a chatbot inside a well-realized robot would behave with the same shallow verbosity that chatbots presently do, and that alone is a creepy image. i was pleased that they went so far as to address the evil AI's nature as a digital entity, untied to one body, and able to move through computer networks.
