basically as good as the first one, although certain aspects fall off (some bad direction and really bad dialogue). takes a bit of pinhead's mystique away by making him a british colonial, but i guess he had to have been merely A Man if he came garbed in bondage gear. it would make less sense if he were an alien as i wanted him to be. the otherworldly location was cool, and i really liked what happened with the evil doctor guy and how he became a cenobite. the film was fairly successful in drawing a parallel between his professorial lust for power-knowledge and sexual sadism. i liked the introduction of the theresa character, and appreciated how the main girl continued to go unviolated (we get close, but never see the hooks ripping HER flesh apart).

thought it was a bit rude that "Female Cenobite" doesn't get her own nickname, like "Vagina Throat" or whatever.
