watched this on the recommendation of paul schrader, who celebrated this as a contemporary film of the digital era that "breaks all the rules because it doesn't even know them." it breaks a lot of filmmaking rules, sure, but also narrative ones (IYKYK). the cinematography in this is way better than it has any right to be. funny, emotionally affecting, funny characters, the script has a cinephilia that i found surprising---which is uncommon for me in movies about movies.
