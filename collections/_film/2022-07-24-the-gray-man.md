i wonder what algorithm the russo brothers consulted to decide whether or not to show the pulled fingernails during the torture scene. "the shot cannot last longer than 1.2 seconds but must exceed 0.9 seconds in order to realize maximum profits. expected ROI is 31% when amortized against billy bob's contract, which stipulates a 13% increase of salary per fingernail."
