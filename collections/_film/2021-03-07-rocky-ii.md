damn this is so much fucking worse than the first one. the training montage is not really significantly better than in the first, which is kinda what i remembered this one having; the cinematography is so much worse--the first had all these incredible wide, deep shots of stunning urban decay, cool angles, etc.

the script for the first was really perfectly executed as well; super minimal, incredibly effective. this one is also very workmanlike in the same kinda way--formulaic, not necessarily in a negative sense, but not really able to express creativity within the confines of the formula. the script for the first rocky movie was formulaic but still just perfectly structured. so much heart.

i thought that the montage sequence with Eye of the Tiger was in this one. now i feel like i have blue balls and i'm just chasing it down. gotta watch rocky 3, it must be there.

this movie was not very good, but i still like it because i just love training montages, i can't help it. i love inspiration based around physicality.

can't believe how fucking good the chugging 5 raw eggs and going for a run at 4am scene in the first one was, gd lol.
