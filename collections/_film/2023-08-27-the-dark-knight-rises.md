i wanted to watch this ever since i was reminded of the opening airplane sequence by a similar set piece in the latest Mission: Impossible. the film is definitely fascist, but it's also very technically accomplished---nolan's signature as an artist is his ability to use cinema to re-make reality on an epic scale. 

the design and performance of Bane is so, so good. a very worthwhile follow up to heath ledger's joker, and much better than the first film's ambiguous villain.
