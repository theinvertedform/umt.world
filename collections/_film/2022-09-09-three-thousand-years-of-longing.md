excellent performances, with some especially great line readings from idris elba. a nice, minimal little film with some interesting narrative turns. i thought it was that the film had a dramaturge, but the structure feels so strange. the manner in which the second act climax occurs, as well as its placement, felt a bit off; it also felt like it ended multiple times (another sign something is going on structurally). hard to tell if it's intentional, or if it was just very difficult to tell this story with the pacing and tone he wanted.
