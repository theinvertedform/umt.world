it's really admirable how committed these films are to "coolness" and "style." a lot of the nu-metal/rapcore techno style music choices haven't aged well, on the face of it; but if you approach the film on its level, it is a really pleasurable, immersive aesthetic experience. i will also say that i got a lot more out of the deep lore in this one than any of the 5+ times i've seen this movie (i was paying really close attention, in anticipation of rewatching Resurrections), but i still found myself having a hard time tracking wtf is going on with Agent Smith.
