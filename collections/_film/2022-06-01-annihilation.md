i hate to say it, but i can't unsee what a commentor for Devs wrote: garland's women are all trope-laden losers pining for their man. this movie...was not very good. JJL sucked ass. natalie portman doing a decent job, but kind of by-the-numbers. oscar isaac looked like he was having fun in the camcorder footage, at least. pretty lame sting at the end, but i did quite like the whole climactic sequence in the lighthouse. idk, the characters just weren't there i guess, and the CGI monster did not look very good (sounded cool though).
