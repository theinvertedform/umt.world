i have the feeling that i've watched something from this artist before. it might just be that there have been so many artists who play with stick figures and weird philosophy that it gives me a sense of déjà vu. the narrative was pretty creative with its technical details, and contained a good amount of turns. the story of david was incredibly fucked up; the clone stuff, i was less hooked by. emily's performance was a really pleasant anchor throughout the short runtime, a constant delight as the clone's story got more and more bleak. the animation itself was quite nice, but i am having a bit of a hard time connecting it as a medium to the narrative in a way that doesn't seem arbitrary. apparently this is the artist's first digitally-animated piece, and it retains a lot of the hand-drawn aesthetics of his earlier work---but that's not something that i really know anything about...
