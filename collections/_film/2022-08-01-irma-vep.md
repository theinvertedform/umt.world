first time i watched a show---excuse me, "serial"---week by week in a long time. i saw Les vampires in a church for nuit blanche when i was a teenager. sat through the entire thing, all seven hours of it. i remember the plot being really quite stupid. i couldn't sit through the assayas's 90s film version. this show was great. funny, sexy, cute, and some nice layered meditations on cinema.
