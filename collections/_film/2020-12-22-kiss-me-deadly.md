feels aesthetically like an extended episode of the twilight zone. not in a condescending way, and not only because of the scifi elements of the plot. 50s aesthetics are just so distinct from decades prior; whereas the 40s and downward feel more cognitively distinct as from another historical era--definitely ancient, definitely from a very distant past--the 50s feels close to the contemporary, but it still has that antique edge to it. i'm talking about the production design.

maybe that has to do with the non-cinematic qualities of this film and the production design (again), including costuming. i feel like, in a lot of 50s films that aren't headed by big stars that we still recognize today, the actors look extremely normal--as though they are non-actors pulled off the street.

i think that this film is just not cinematic in its production design and casting. it's still quite good, though, and very relaxing. i like 50s american genre films because they function as relaxing, low-stakes movies that you can half pay attention to, but the cinematic conventions of the time are still infinitely classier than those of today; and there is not this potential alienation of watching movies from earlier decades, whose antiquity might make them hard to digest for the brain-addled.
