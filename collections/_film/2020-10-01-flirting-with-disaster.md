A little rom-com that I watched in the background while doing some coding. I liked Ben Stiller's high-waisted, pleated wool pants, and the oversized shirt tucked into them--very 90s, very cool. I liked Patricia Arquette's mom look, and Josh Brolin was great. Also really loved the second son of the main character's parents, in the final section of the movie.
