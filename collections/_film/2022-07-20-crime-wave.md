Stayed late after work on Sunday night drinking sour beer. It was our weekend, so we all went to a colleague's house nearby. Ended up staying in the park until around 7am, drinking wine, stolen ciders, smoking hash joints. Got wasted to the point where I was insensible. Three of us got breakfast at the Green Spot, 7am on a Monday. Two eggs and bacon. Couldn't finish my toast. Folger's coffee never tasted so good. Said goodbye; I remember everything except how I got up Atwater. I must have walked my bike. Things are bad at home, so I slept off to the side of the soccer pitch at McGill for a few hours. Woke up around 10:30am. Wanted to go see a movie, but the earliest screening was 12:30. Biked slowly back to Concordia and went to the VCR. The individual stations were reserved for Fantasia media. I didn't recognize any of the titles they offered me, so I pulled a few random film noir from the shelves. Got a sausage McMuffin and a coffee from McDonald's. Fell asleep on the floor before I got to see how the guy got out of his jam, if he co-operated with the cops or stayed loyal to his friends. It wasn't a good film anyway.
