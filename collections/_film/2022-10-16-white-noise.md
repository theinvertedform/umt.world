Baumbach is entering his Altman-on-PCP phase. I read White Noise many years ago, don't remember much, but the chaos of the group scenes does seem to capture my memory of the novel's vibe. As well, the subtextual, background theme of environmentalism. Adam Driver is really great: best joke in the movie was "I teach Advanced Naziism at the College-on-the-Hill." Greta Gerwig's big scene where she acts quite intensely did make me wonder if it was appropriate to the material. A cool, complex, very "postmodern" movie that made me wonder if cinema is in some way developing the capacity to operate in the same textual register that this particular wave of American literature was in the 80s and 90s.
