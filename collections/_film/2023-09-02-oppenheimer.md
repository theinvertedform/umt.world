"Now, the cultural arms race is not driven by external threats of fascism or communism, since Hollywood has long been the hegemonic power. Rather, it is driven by the internal contradictions of capital. Each new turn of the screw becomes more demanding than the last. Christopher Nolan has promised to deliver Spirit from its manic and cease‑ less plunge through the earth’s crust. Once a mortal like you and I, he climbed higher up the steps of the ziggurat than anyone else, and has since become one with the Sun. An emperor who, not content with expanse or depth, has set his sights on the heavens, determined to re‑build the cosmos in his own image. Every three to four years, when the God‑Emperor returns from on high to demand tribute, millions upon millions bend the hip, take their seats, and sublimate themselves before his almighty ego. Christopher Nolan, who uses a flip‑phone and stays off social media, is bent on single‑handedly curing society of the disease of modern alienation by forcing us all to return to ritual and worship of the analogue."
