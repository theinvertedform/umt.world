i love the way danny boyle uses media. i love the way his representation of the new in contemporary culture has evolved from his weird digital nonsense, as in The Beach and Millions; to the incomprehensibility of the club sequence in this. very well put together, themes well developed...the worst part was the whole plot with the antagonist.
