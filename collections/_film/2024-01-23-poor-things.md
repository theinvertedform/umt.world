enjoyed this a lot more than any of his previous films. manages to avoid the same bullshit cynicism present in the guy I am most inclined to compare Lanthimos to—Ruben Ostlund. this one had something sincere in the story. an excellent choice, filled with details that fit this guy's sensibility, but still anchored by a heartfelt moral.
