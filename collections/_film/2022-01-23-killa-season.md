a quite remarkable piece of outsider art that deserves some serious ethnographic study. surprisingly well-made with a competently structured script that hits all the right beats at the right times; cam'ron also employs a healthy diversity with cinematic techniques, including montages! to me it speaks of genuine artistic inspiration that cam'ron self-financed his own film, based on his life and experience of hood realness.
