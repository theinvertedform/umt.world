watched this for marlene dietrich. sometimes you can laugh at the funny quaintness of the culture depicted in old movies; sometimes it's incredibly unfunny. there is an extremely violent and protracted brawl between dietrich and another female character, where they are surrounded by a huge mob of men laughing, cheering, placing bets as they roll around, punching and pulling hair. obviously not as violent as contemporary action, but in its historic context it becomes something really disturbing.
