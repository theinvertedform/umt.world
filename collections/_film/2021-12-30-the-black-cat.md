not quite as expertly realized as Detour (obv), but still quite an impressive feat given the time and financial constraints ulmer was working under. some really cool lighting effects and production design, some really creepy plot elements, such as the satanists and the flaying alive; performances, especially from karloff, are off the charts. hated the normie characters and hated the tag on the end.
