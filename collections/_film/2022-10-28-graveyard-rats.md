ok yes it was fun to see a new work from the guy who did Cube and Nothing, both formative films for me going up. this was slightly better than Lot 36: some really crazy camerawork, the monsters had a formal aesthetic that at least assumes some degree of creative intent...but in general, this was not good. just too slight of a story i think.
