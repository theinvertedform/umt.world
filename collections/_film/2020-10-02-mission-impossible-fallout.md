Mission Impossible films are truly about nothing. Pure spectacle, the plots are an echo from the time period of the first film. A cabal of "anarchists" with no greater motivation than to destroy, and who use a nuclear bomb, no less? It's from another period of history, and is completely devoid of any subtext that makes the film "about" something more than its plot. 

The chase scenes through Paris were pretty cool, as was the first fight scene in the washroom.
