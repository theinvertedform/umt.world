tina campt joined us via zoom in class today. we started off watching + discussing Love is the Message... at the part in tina campt's book where she is talking about visual frequency and doing a close reading of this film, Apex. prof said we hadn't watched it because she couldn't find it, so tina shared screen and we all got to see it. :)

my excitement was short-lived because the film is quite painful to watch lol. i think Love is the Message is actually a lot more painful because the violence depicted is represented in moving image form, whereas this one is made up of 800 still images. there are quite a significant amount of images depicting violence and gore, but the narrative aspect of the moving image (and the song) in Love is the Message just make the violence hit a lot harder. this one is kinda abstract.
