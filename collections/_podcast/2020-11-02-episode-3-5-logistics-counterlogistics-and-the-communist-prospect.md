In this very special episode recorded on Halloween, and released on the eve of the American presidential election, we are discussing Jasper Bernes’s (@outsidagitator) essay on the history of logistics. Posited as capital’s theory of its own globalized form, the essay situates us in 2011, the same moment of historical upheaval this entire collection of essays has focused on. We discuss the concepts of “cognitive mapping” taken from Frederic Jameson, “hydraulic capitalism” taken from Deleuze and Guattari, Heideggerean ontology, technological alienation, and more.
