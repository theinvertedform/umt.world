Before we get into volume 5 of the Endnotes journal, we are going to take some time to read a few assorted essays to round out our understanding of the communisation current. In this episode, we are reading a contribution by John Clegg and Aaron Benanav, two members of the collective, to a collection on the Frankfurt School. The essay covers familiar territory, focusing on surplus populations, capitalist crisis, and workerâ€™s identity; but there are a few turns of phrase that articulate these familiar Endnotes talking points really well, and could potentially make the essay good reading material for people who want a deeper understanding of the matter.
