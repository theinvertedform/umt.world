This intake to Endnotes 4 is an analysis of urbanism, from the Debordian perspective that capitalism has successfully managed to collapse space in the form of the suburb, the greenfield, the urban metropole. This essay begins with that analysis, but takes it further afield by analyzing the history of housing and urban development in the United States, how it plays into processes of racialisation as well as the eradication of the worker’s identity.
