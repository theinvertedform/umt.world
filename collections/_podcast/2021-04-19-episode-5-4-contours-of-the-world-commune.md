The Friends of the Classless Society intake to Endnotes 5 is a straight-up piece of social fiction, discussing in great detail how a communist utopia would function. It is quite satisfying on an immediate level to read such a detailed piece of utopian social imagining, and our discussion in this episode ranges quite widely.
