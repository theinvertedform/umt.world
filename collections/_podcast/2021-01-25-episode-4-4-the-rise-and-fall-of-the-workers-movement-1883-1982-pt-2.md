Our second episode on the long essay in Endnotes 4 on the history of the worker’s movement. Join us for another discussion that runs the gamut, from discussing billionaires, neo-feudalism, the Avatar remakes, to the early decades of the worker’s movement.

Remember that we have a Discord community (DM for an invite) and a Patreon where you can support the show. https://www.patreon.com/theinvertedform
