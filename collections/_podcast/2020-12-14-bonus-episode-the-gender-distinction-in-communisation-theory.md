Another bonus episode before we get into volume 4 in the new year, continuing the discussion from last week, and the discussion that started from The Logic of Gender essay in Endnotes 3. This time we are reading P. Valentine’s 2012 contribution to the LIES Journal, coming out of Oakland / elsewhere. This is a critical intervention to the communisation tendency, especially the conversations happening around gender. An outsider perspective that directs its critique inward, toward the movement in a confrontational and polemical manner–much different from Endnotes’ tendency to direct its critique outward, toward easy targets like the police and the state.
