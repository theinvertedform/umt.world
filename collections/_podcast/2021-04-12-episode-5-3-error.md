How does the revolutionary insert themselves into the capitalist totality? What kind of totality is capitalism, anyway? It has a definite beginning, but is it possible that it is logically determined to stretch into infinity? How do we extricate ourselves from this totality? As a totality based on a particular mode of production, capitalism can be located in its physical residueâ€”infrastructure in the form of technology and architecture. Is technology neutral in the class struggle? We enter into all of this and more via a discussion on contemporary COVID politics and some reflections on the past summer, and what might come of the second summer of the Pandemic Age.
