Wrapping up volume 3 of Endnotes with a meditation on the relationship between the nature of anti-capitalist struggle, the role of militants in realizing that struggle, and what struggle can hope to accomplish. This essay further advances a definition of communisation, and develops the collectiveâ€™s vision for the conditions of possibility of a communist revolution. It ends on a very intriguing cliffhanger, too, arguing that class consciousness is not a sufficient basis for revolution, but that capital is really the one thing we all have in common.
