In this episode we talk about Hegel, we discuss Endnotes’s essay on the wave of riots that swept through Eastern Europe in early 2014, and we focus in again on the “composition problem.” One of the key theoretical points made in the essay under review is that the problem of a lack of demands is identical to the “composition problem,” but that the former can be seen in a positive light–a movement’s lack of demands leaves it open to the possibility of full-on communist insurrection. We continue to puzzle over what communization might mean, and get even deeper into its logos.
