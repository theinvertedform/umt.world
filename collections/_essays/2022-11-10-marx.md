I read the Fawkes translation in the summer of 2017 or 2018. I carried it with me for four months backpacking around Europe. I loved every bit of it. I am looking forward to re-reading in the Winter 2023 academic semester, especially now alongside Hegel.

This page, like my page for Hegel, will initially be built around my reading notes, and possibly notes from the reading group. My ambition is to have questions, quotes, and perhaps synopses for each section.

# Metabolic rift

The ecology is very important!

# Ethical principles

Which comes first for the existing one, the rational or the ethical?

# Revolutionary theory

Marxism is important not just because it gives us conceptual tools, but because it gives us a political theory!
