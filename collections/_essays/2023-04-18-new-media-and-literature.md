Graphic design is as old as the written word. When the first obelisks were unveiled in ancient Mesopotamia, their surfaces covered with the bird-like scratches of cuneiform, it was through technological mediation that man inscribed the beginning of history.

!["Cave paintings are the origin of graphic design. They represent a "technology" in the sense that they are accomplished by means of a tool to join two separate things. Tablets are especially important in the history of art-as-technology, in my view, because they represent the invention of a new medium of art through the synthesis of two previously separate entities" [@meggs2012, 11].](/assets/images/blau.png)

Up until the height of the European medieval manuscript, graphic design developed as a corollary to the fine arts tradition. The most technically-advanced manuscript on record, the *Tres Riches Heures* du Duc de Berry, resembles the Gothic art of its time. It was not until the invention of the printing press that graphic design, the technique and visual culture associated with a specifically mass form of media, could detach from the artisanal culture of the fine arts.

Before Gutenberg invented his movable type printing press circa 1450 [@meggs2012, 72], books were handmade craft products. Pages of illuminated manuscripts were made from vellum (calf skin), stretched thin and scraped into a supple, pearlescent parchment. The vellum was cut into folio sheets and bound together in a series of leaves. "Of Gutenberg's famous 42-line Bible perhaps only a couple of hundred were produced, some on paper, the rest on vellum. Each vellum copy used the skins of 170 animals" [@thereformationto1700]. Most manuscript production was either commissioned through patronage, as in the case of the Duc de Berry, who kept the three Limbourg brothers in his employ; or it was done in medieval scriptoria set up for high-volume production. The monks ran these scriptoria like factories, with an assembly line breaking up production into a series of specialized tasks. The *scrittori* was art director; the *copisti* was responsible for lettering; and the illuminator drew the pictures [@meggs2012, 47]. A single scribe needed four or five months to produce one 200-page volume [@meggs2012, 68]. Ever-growing demand, especially for Books of Hours, provided the market pressure that incentivized the development of printing technology.

# John Milton's Commonplace Book

The commonplace book of John Milton (1608--1674) survived by accident until it was discovered in 1894 [@mohl1969, 5]. Milton was trained to keep a commonplace book through his education in the British grammar schools of his time. This system was based principally on the teachings of the great Renaissance humanist Erasmus (1466--1536). In the Renaissance tradition of study, the pupil reads closely from a limited canon of classical literature; from this corpus, they select and extract key phrases and copy them down in a personal notebook, adding commentary. This was understood as a practise of literary training through mimesis, but the scholarly function of the commonplace book was to save the "place" of arguments, proofs, and examples within the canonical texts [@mohl1969, 16--17]. It aided retrieval of information without needing to rely on fallible memory. Every entry in the book contains a citation detailing the location and the source of the extract. Entries are organized under topic headings, which are then indexed in order to allow cross-fertilization between entries and topics (see [#ref:locke]). There is no universal method to keeping a commonplace book, only shared principles. The index and the thematic organization are what allow each book to express the individuality of its writer. In *Tom Jones* (1749), Mr. Thwackum reads from his commonplace book, but from under the heading "Drunkenness;" and out of comedic propriety the narrator declines to transcribe what is read [@mohl1969, 25]. Canonical sources are organized according to topics that reflect the student's understanding and interests. This technique of study was common enough that "the wide use of citations and quotations" becomes a stylistic hallmark of Renaissance literature [@mohl1969, 23].

# Note-taking systems

The method of commonplace note-taking was developed using the book format, but an alternative format with a similar principle emerged with the invention of the card index in Germany around 1700 [@cevolini2016b, 9]. This alternative format consisted of smaller, individual pieces of paper, each one containing a single individual commonplace entry. Still indexed, still arranged under topics, and still containing citations, the major difference was that "loose file cards are best suited to the construction of an unlimitedly expandable knowledge container" [@cevolini2016b, 9]. Such a filing system does not operate in the strict linear fashion entailed by a ruled, paginated bundle of leaves. Walter Benjamin (1892--1940) is one 20th century writer who practised the commonplace method using slips of paper, arranged in the manner of a database. *The Arcades Project*, unfinished in his lifetime but posthumously published, has

## The Arcades Project

The method Benjamin used in constructing the manuscript for his *Arcades Project* is a system of knowledge management that continues from the tradition of the commonplace book. The alternative format of the card file entails a different system of numbering than simple sequential pagination. Since notes are intended to be inserted anywhere, how do you number them? German sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927--1998) developed an alphanumeric system for a collection of over 90,000 individual notes, collected over 40 years and forming the basis of over 600 published articles [@schmidt2016]. The most technically-advanced commonplace methods developed by John Locke, Francis Bacon, and other humanists resemble contemporary databases in structure, but the card indexes and complex numbering systems developed by Benjamin and Luhmann come to resemble databases in their new media form.

# Project Xanadu

In 1960, computer scientist and sociologist Ted Nelson (1937-- ) developed an early example of word processing software for his graduate project at Harvard University [@nelson1984, 1/18]. Over the following years, as he continued working across sociology and computer science, Nelson and his collaborators continued to work on a concept he coined called "hypertext...combining text editing and idea-management with non-sequential writing" [@nelson1984, 1/19]. The project would expand far beyond the initial vision of a simple word processing program. In the film *Citizen Kane* (1941), Xanadu, estate of Charles Foster Kane, comes to represent the hollow and lonely utopian vision of a man who came close to grasping his object of power. "Project Xanadu" was the name of an integrated software model, information network, physical infrastructure program, and publishing/distribution/proto-social media platform that represents a planned vision of the Internet. Its status as an unrealized, hopelessly idealistic fantasy of a utopian Internet is self-deprecatingly reflected in the name Xanadu. In reality, the Internet and digital life as we know it emerged haphazardly through market competition, shared protocols like TCP/IP only agreed upon through the enforcement of governing bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Project Xanadu was designed from the ground up, and would have put in place from the outset many of the practises that had to be won over time. Project Xanadu bears an uncanny resemblance to the Internet we are used to, imagined for a fantasy world whose rationality bears little resemblance to our own. 

On the Project Xanadu network, rather than having competing platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc, there is only one distribution platform. Nelson compares his project to a "printing press," even as he describes technical details relating to document structure---complete with a kitschy 80s vision of "local outposts...where you'll start your account and learn to use the system. A cheery young person in futuristic garb will sit you down at a screen..." [@nelson1984, 3/6]. The dream was to create a single virtual commons where all types of media can be interchanged, cross-linked, revised, and collaborated on in a system with automatic version control, acknowledgements, and royalties built in. If you read Shakespeare's *Hamlet* on Xanadu, a portion of your subscription fee goes to the author's estate. If you read an edited version, a proportion goes to the revision author. That proportion is based on how much of what you access is a revision. Instead of this rational, cathedral-like system, the early Internet was a chaotic field of wild competition that inevitably settled into a familiar monopoly capitalism. However, it would have been irrational for a capitalist firm, as Ted Nelson's once-CIA-backed Project Xanadu corporation explicitly was, to not pursue the profits associated with surveillance capitalism. Surveillance would become the basis of the entire online economy.

# The Proletariat's Interest

The subscription-based revenue model is marginally more advantageous to the proletariat. The customer presumes that they are the ones who pay for the service through their subscription fee, and the firm's only incentive is to maintain a good relationship with the customer by developing technologies that will make them use the service more. Facebook provides services that are free to use, and the proletariat knows that the company is being incentivized through their use of those services. The product offered by Facebook, and all other digital platforms, is the data generated by customer use; its customers are advertisers. However, because social media networks are designed to appeal to the mass user, the mechanisms that actually generate profit out of that use are concealed from users. The business serves its own interests, but deceitfully designs its service around the veneer of an appealing user experience. A subscription-only model, in its most basic form, creates a dynamic where the company is able to generate profit without needing to go the extra step of surveilling its users in order to sell ads. Netflix and other subscription services were developed after the standard model of renting, and after the surveillance model; there is absolutely no reason to think that if Xanadu had caught on at the onset of the digital age that it would not have modified its terms and conditions in order to generate profits through surveillance. 

Graphic design, the commonplace note-taking method in the form of a card index, and the rational principles of hypertext are the foundations of my approach to writing and thinking with new media. "Visual strategies used for meaning or persuasion are hardly new, but their importance has been amplified by the visual and interactive nature of native hypertext and multimedia writing" [@hocks2003, 629]. Knowledge is mediated by a technical intervention into some material. There is always a visual craft dimension of literature, and the tools used in that craft affect the style of writing. On the other end of the production--consumption cycle, the presentation and design of literature affects how it is read. The technology of digital writing environments has been advanced to suit the needs of the computer programmer. Code and natural language are different forms of writing: a new media writer should take advantage of the same tools as the most advanced computer programmer. Not only should they use the tools of a computer programmer, but the writer should be able to design and implement their own publishing system. This would be easier if we lived under the regime of Ted Nelson, but the World Wide Web suffices as one's home base. An important feature of writing for the World Wide Web is the combination of production and publication environments: the writer needs to be able to edit and re-factor their website at a moment's notice. The website represents something that can potentially combine aspects of the commonplace study technique, with the literary and visual rhetoric that are specific to new media. To do so, the writer's training should include some degree of computer science-based work.
