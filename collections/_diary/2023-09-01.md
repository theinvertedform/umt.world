title: A Home for Wayward Boys
---

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

I was walking by some lurking house in Toronto when I was struck by a wave of foul air. What came to mind was the idea of a home for wayward boys, but the plot of land it's on emits a permanent stink...

A girl I once knew now looks away from me. I look bad, dressed in tattered clothing. I smell bad: my pheromones are rank. My aura radiates invisible stink lines.

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Apply at Concordia. Send pitches for the Wolfgang review. Read Gravity's Rainbow. Read Hegel. Go to the gym. Try not to think about money. Apply for jobs.

And at what point during all of this will I find a wife? How can I measure progress there? Instead, I sublimate my desire into exercise and writing. If I can't be happy, at least I can be a jacked artist. I want to press a plate overhead and publish a novel.

title: E--'s First Class of the Semester
---

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

In the VA lunchroom before E--'s first class of the semester. Lights low, plastic furniture, quiet, only a few scared-looking art students with their heads down. I can't lose the momentum of the APCON piece. One really needs to be constantly sending pitches if publishing is going to work---multiple every day; for the Wolfgang review, for whatever. Publish it anywhere, so long as it's somewhere (other than here).

title: On the *via negativa*
---

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

My goal right now is to respond to V--'s email, and to send the pitch to at least one more magazine.

Can't do the latter. Difficult enough to do the former. Too distracted by thoughts of girls and love. I am not available to women because I don't exist. No-one cares, and they're right not to.

*Just before 16h*---Everything is futile. I have zero prospects. Nothing but sadness, loneliness. Life of the modern gymcel. Life of the modern man. I should go back to l'E and tell that girl the truth: that I liked how her eyes flashed in that ellipsis between dodging drunks.

*'Round midnight*---Maybe if I wore more tonal outfits, like the guy wearing a white cowboy outfit on the couch opposite me here at CDP. Maybe if I had bigger lateral deltoids. Maybe if I had used sunscreen in the morning for the past ten years, and my face were not so wrinkled; maybe If I were just one degree higher in my profession. Maybe if I had finished that third reading of the *Phenomenology of Spirit*, someone would love me.

Is ogling women on the street really better than using an app? Infinite possibilities emerge out of the city. The café is *here*---I'm at one right now; apps are elsewhere. An added layer of mediation. We approach closest to God through reduction (*via negativa*). For a communist utopia to become actual, it similarly will require reduction (de-growth communism), not least being the abolition of class. Most importantly, a wife will be found by removing everything until only she remains.

Saw E-- last week; saw J-- and her Lil' Peep boyfriend today. Next time, it will be C-- ---or more likely, R--. Maybe A-- is back in town. I saw M--'s face floating in the crowd of a street festival. I haven't seen her in years, but her memory returned immediately. The city's mysteries conspire with memory, and the meanings they create confirm the purposiveness of life.

When I saw M--'s face floating in the crowd, I felt like I could love her. I'm holding on to an attachment from when I was still naive. She has a connection to the earth, I have a watery depth. *We are both graves to each other*.

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

Sometimes one can be so drawn into the pleasure of their sensing-body that we might be mistaken to lapse into idyll, for it is then that Life will remind you of your own facticity. The scorching ray of an all-seeing eye falls on you, and you are brought crashing into an outline of yourself. Who we have been anchors us, a Protestant fetter that privileges one to carry it to this day.

We might disagree on the nature of organism and its connection to *cogito*, but we all agree on disliking being interpellated. In the course of a life, we grow an avatar that connects to the web on our behalf; and if we fail to repay our debts, it is the solemn duty of the creditor to stick pins through our hollow joints, sending bolts of screaming blue out of the interface. Sometimes we might lapse into idyll, and need to be reminded of our own facticity. The iron edifice of fiduciary obligation. 

There's no more rude reminder of our contingency than through manipulation of this *post hoc* self. Debt hangs like an alien spectre that phases into the corporeal when you require discipline. A creature of the imagination, yet with the power to turn one's vision black with pain from nowhere. *Don't make me do it. I don't like it any more than you do.* The trace of the way we lived in the world; who we are, best understood as *that which we are no longer*. A tether to the past, an Albatross, but---let's be honest: have we really changed? Aren't we still the same desperate phylum scrabbling for survival, borrowing money without a plan for how to pay it back from someone whose memory is liable to split our mind's dioptre? 

Remember? Remember? Still there, out of sight but adjacent, still in the same world as you.

*hello*

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Felt terrible on Friday night when I learned that F-- pet one of the ladies who is always here. It felt like no such thing could ever happen to me. He has a girlfriend, and his girlfriend is also his landlord. The man is living on Easy Street.

Then I woke up too early, went to work tired, barely tried. Minimal effort because nothing matters, I don't do fuck all.

I remember a dream where my bike was stolen.

title: First Memory of Forming Words
---

## Saturday {.chapter-subsection}

Idea for a portfolio piece: a short work, almost like a chant, all rhythm, mostly questions. Give it some form, but its function is to list everything I know, everything I've ever wanted to learn, everything I've ever asked myself. Give it a kind of chronology, make it also a story of coming-of-age. The questions compound. Start with writing Jack and the Bean-stalk in kindergarten (first memory of forming words); then copying out *Narnia*; then writing stories and poems to express sex- and power-fantasies. The poem I wrote about 9/11. Musical father, visual mother. Both proletariat. Became a philosopher all on my own. Make the reader feel how it felt to be on the outside.

## Wednesday {.chapter-subsection}

The second (?) time this year I had a transaction declined for insufficient funds. I like that it's a "coffee bar" here. Has the same set-up as a bar, serves alcohol---although, I will say that this shade of green is not a pastel...

There are too many beautiful women here, with too much skin showing. It's hot out today. Mini-heat wave. I overdressed. This is not even to mention the nipples through cheap tank tops.

title: The Rain Theory
---

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

What are we going to research for the APCON piece?

- Epicurus is the rain guy
- Who's the Eternal Return guy? We studied this in Falcone's class. I can't immediately recall because I'm a sub-par student. In a way, it's like learning math: a useful exercise for the brain, more efficient if you can do the operation internally, but ultimately no big deal thanks to the technology of the calculator (the Stanford encyclopedia).
- Who are we going to cite for the indigenous cosmologies? Leanne Simpson? What do these cosmologies even consist of?

The third is supposed to relate to process philosophy. It's a vision of life as inter-connected movement.

*The encounter with M-- happens here.*

title: What's Happening With M--
---

## Saturday {.chapter-subsection}

What's happening with M--? I felt bad right away, and now I'm worried. My reflex is to fear that she's going to fall in love. I the specimen am sick with constant self-loathing; but egotism, seemingly the contrary of that basic condition, grows from the same narcissistic seed.

I keep getting picked up---picked up off the street like a piece of trash---; I am "husband material," as F-- put it. I'm easy---"the town bicycle," as A-- once put it. Why can't I say *no* to someone? Afraid to hurt their feelings?

Woman need to learn how to decline offers of sex at some ungodly age. The world threatens, and so she needs to defend herself to survive. Whereas for me---for men, it's an offer; something I want, but which must be offered.

If I were responsible, I would not have engaged with her to begin with...but she was really fun and I'm hard up. I'm not good at pursuing women I have an actual interest in.

Now I will tell her how much I liked her flirting, her attention, and that we are not right for each other and we will not know each other again...

title: Windows Closed, Dust Inside
---

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Put off seeing M--. Woke up around 10 with a heavily congested nose. Windows closed, dust inside. Dozed for another hour...then went to the cafe on Mont-Royal. One coffee not enough. Beauty everywhere. Fuck it.

For the University of Western Ontario, I'm supposed to submit two academic essays. The first will be my final for the hauntology class, [on the uncanny and phantasmagoria](/the-truth-is-haunted). It needs to be revised, which will feel good because it's profound (for me). I've put a lot of work into it, so it must be good-ish. I know I can make it much better. It would be quite amazing if I could properly integrate Hegel, but that would take a tremendous amount of work.

[The above entry was written at R between 14h--15h. I was scheduled for 14h, but there was not enough work so I sat around for an hour before I walked out and did not return.]

title: "*Action de Grâce*"
---

## Monday {.chapter-subsection}

Slept on the couch because too depressed to go to bed. Only left the house late. How am I going to find a new job? Don't have what it takes to go out looking. I don't have what it takes to go on. *You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on.* I deserve something better: I deserve a job that doesn't make me wish I were dead.

All alone on the *action de grâce*. What should I be thankful for?

- Fit, strong, muscular, as I worked hard to achieve
- Face is fine
- Apartment
- Good cat, healthy and sweet
- Hair
- Tall end of average height
- Friends who are nice to me, and with whom I mostly like to spend time. They'll be gone now that I no longer work there.

title: What my Voice Reveals
---

## Wednesday {.chapter-subsection}

When I gave my order to the Olimpi-bro, I could feel the girl in front of me's surprise. My voice reveals something that my visage doesn't. Inwardness, infinite inwardness.

*Later, at Bishop*---These diary entries are something, but I will often just skip over a description of the most important events of my life. I need more description of the world outside myself.

Right now I am sitting at Bishop \& Bagg, 1.5 pints deep. I've just finished sending emails to V-- and C--. The first, an apology, as well as an attempt at eroticism. Got explicit, used a few of the magic words.

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

Pulled into a sickening loop with Palestine news. Pulled into posting in a manner that is unbecoming because of how pointless it is. Everything seems pointless.
