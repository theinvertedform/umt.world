## Thursday {.chapter-subsection}

The difference between faith and Enlightenment is contained in the difference between D-- and myself. "Ethical non-monogamy" as a high-tech solution to the problem of lack of roots (family).

Impossible to focus. While I sit here under the lamp at my dining room table, a strange girl is wandering around the kitchen muttering like a meth-head. Big headphones on to make sure I can't bother her.

What is the point of telling a story? Nobody cares, not even me. We can only hope to be as real as possible---even going so far as to replicate the fractious structure of thought. And don't forget to *[negate the negation](https://youtu.be/xyqvEJs93oc?si=bvLl8_7MV6rVaCJW)*.

The main character is always the narrator, who should win us over with the depth of his gaze and the consistency of his voice. The reader cares about the narrator just as much as other characters. The narration of D--, who does not represent herself, must be neutralized. No character will ever work if they are a caricature. Like Chekhov:

> What I admire most about Chekhov is how free of agenda he seems on the page—interested in everything but not wedded to any fixed system of belief, willing to go wherever the data takes him. He was a doctor, and his approach to fiction feels lovingly diagnostic. Walking into the examination room, finding Life sitting there, he seems to say, “Wonderful, let’s see what’s going on!” It’s not that he didn’t have strong opinions (his letters are proof that he did). But in his best stories (and here I’d include, in addition to the three in this book, “The Lady with the Pet Dog,” “In the Ravine,” “Enemies,” “About Love,” and “The Bishop”) he seems to be using the form to move beyond opinions, to destabilize the usual ways we go about formulating them. --- [@saunders2021, 343]

## Saturday {.chapter-subsection}

Do I really have something so smart to say? Yes, I do, because it's easy and even hacks can come up with an original idea. I have something very profound and important to say about the nature of technology, media, art, society. It would be gratifying. Smarter, and even less happy.

Pros							Cons
-----    						-----
Become extra smart				Leave Tony
Write a thesis					Leave the precious apartment
Learn German					Lose all my career developments
New place, new opportunity  	Lose my precious social life
Potential detox, retreat		Lose my French

title: Ritual and Sacrifice
---

## Monday {.chapter-subsection}

The proposed solution is to not change anything. *If you feel like you are making progress, why change?* We know from exercise science that shock and constant variety are bad. You need to settle in, find a rhythm and pursue progress until the end. The only reason to change is when you have stopped making progress, or if you need to focus on an under-developed area.

But If I don't go to Western, I need to make a sacrifice. If I give up on Western, it must be because I'm doing something else instead.

Academic studies and highly-developed ideas are how one can set themselves apart as an artist. It's easy enough to be sensitive; it's a greater challenge to have command of one's craft; it is most difficult of all to be sensitive, have a command of one's craft, and also to be knowledgeable. That's what sets one apart: knowledge is power, after all. The final cherry on top is for the knowledge to be instrumentalized, i.e. to have a political ideology.

What sacrifice is called for? Do I want to continue working in restaurants? If I am able to make the same in this new job, or at least to earn the bottom end of the range---and to have up to 40 hours per week; well, there would not be much reason to continue working in service.

Nietzsche said that anyone who has less than two-thirds of the day for themselves is a slave. 21, maybe 28 hours per week, I would have enough money to support myself and enough time to write. But it's not clear if I can't just write right now. I should be able to---there's enough time in the day, after all; it's not like I'm doing something all the time. Ritual is the only thing that can make it work.

To depend on these rituals, this routine, and yet---to remain open to the spontaneity of Being. That's the real challenge. That's the seeming impossibility.

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

Going to see *Les jours parfaits* with A--; her response ("cringe, interminable..."). Meanwhile, I'm over here relating intensely. Communication across generations and the disjuncture of individual worlds are themes in the film. Is there something new in the world, or has my perception of the phenomenon (aging) changed?

What voice could be appropriate for this kind of story? There might be something in the events that constitute enough for a narrative, but the problem is coming up with a perspective that is in itself worth exploring. That extra touch is what distinguishes literature from narration. That's what I don't have.

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

I love how high up the counter by the window at O is. Yesterday I had a terrible crash during training: no energy, no more sugar to keep my going. I have to return to basic principles. Walking is a process of putting one foot in front of the other. I am nothing like these famous writers I read, or the ones I'm competing against. I haven't put in enough time! My craft is nowhere near as good. Needs more STORY. A narrative with twists and turns. Maybe a perspective more interesting than my own. The K-- story---that's what we're building towards. Everything else is practise.

title: Technical Assistance for the More-than-human
---

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

Last week, when I was helping E-- with technical assistance on his new project, I allowed the rusty water to spill beyond its strict confines (whose pristine white is sacred to all print lovers). E-- graciously saw it as an aesthetic element in its own right.

When I first heard him explain twice in the same day the concept behind the project he's working on, I only knew him from his works I had archived just the previous week. His style (from almost 10 years ago) looked like cartoons, like covers of emo records. Tim Burtonesque. It worked, for me.

I was initially skeptical, but my opportunity antenna vibrated at the keyword "more-than-human." Today I began to see his project: I can see his style beginning to emerge through minimal collaboration (editing) of unpredictable natural forces. Rust patterns from salvaged metal plates, facilitated by selected salt waters from around the world, are printed onto paper.

I'm curious to know more about why he has chosen to work in print media, when his other works are much more installation-based.

Water used as a stand-in for the more-than-human carries a lot of political significance. E-- has some kind of project involving elders in Cuba. What is going on across his projects that we can learn from?

My current emotional state: *satisfied*.

## Saturday {.chapter-subsection}

Why do I write in this diary? And to what end do I say that this counts as putting my life on the line?

Erin said: *write like your life depends on it.*

A-- said: *your instinct is to write about yourself.* Somehow, this counts as putting my life on the line? "Interesting," she said---and she has a point. Not that it's interesting, but that my instinct reveals something: my individualism; my narcissism, if we want to be rude about it. Should I be writing more about revolution, more about communist theory? Stories of trade unionists who fall in love? *Spring Breakers*?

If I were to die tomorrow, I would want to express my emotions more than anything. I would want to tell the barista at PR how often I think about her. Tell R-- how much I learned from her. Tell E-- how important she was to me. Tell N-- how little I respect her. Tell A-- how sorry I am.

I see many of these entries as a narrative exercise. Each one is practise in telling a story, but without the hard work of inventing one from scratch. Instead, I can just focus on reporting something, maybe making a joke, a reference or two along the way.

Today, for instance, I got into PR around 10:30am. I was there only about ten minutes before she showed up. We don't make eye contact anymore. I was sitting at the bar, unusually without a book, notebook, laptop---truly just hanging out.

...but there was something in the way she poured me a glass of water that I believe acknowledged everything. In that moment---I felt everything. She didn't make eye contact, but she acknowledged my appreciation with something far more intimate. An averted gaze, an indirect smile.

Was it a shy smile, though? Or just a small one? If I eavesdropped correctly, it's her birthday. A fellow water sign, and another Pisces---just like A--.

She has a sallow beauty, like J--. It implies depth, character, profundity, wisdom, sickliness. It's a complex beauty. She seems inward.

"Looking for a beer?" she asked me as I stood in front of the cooler. In fact, I was waiting to use the toilet.

"Just admiring the colour co-ordination," I said.

"Thank you, I tried to put them in order to make a rainbow."

I am on the cusp of having a girlfriend now, anyway, so I should not be thinking about other women.
