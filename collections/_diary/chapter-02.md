title: Windows Closed, Dust Inside
---

Put off seeing M--. Woke up around 10 with a heavily congested nose. Windows closed, dust inside. Dozed for another hour....then went to M. One coffee not enough. Beauty everywhere. Fuck it.

For the University of Western Ontario, I'm supposed to submit two academic essays. The first can be the last one I wrote for the hauntology class, on the uncanny and the phantasmagoria: it will need to be significantly revised, which will feel good to do, since there's such a strong seed there. I know I can make it much better. The challenge will be to integrate more Hegel in a way appropriate to an academic context, but at the same time, to make sure he stays in the background. It's not an essay on Hegel, after all.

The above entry was written at Reservoir between 14h--15h. I was scheduled for 14h, but there was not enough work so I sat around for an hour. I then walked out and did not return.

title: "*Action de Grâce*"
---

Slept on the couch because too depressed to go to bed. Only left the house late. How am I going to find a new job? Don't have what it takes to go out looking. I don't have what it takes to go on. *You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on.* I deserve something better: I deserve a job that doesn't make me want to kill myself. Nothing has gotten better. My opportunities have only diminished.

All alone on the *action de grâce*. What should I be thankful for?

- Fit, strong, muscular, as I worked hard to achieve
- Cute enough in the face for some girls to come talk to me
- Good apartment
- Good cat, mostly healthy and generally sweet
- Good hair
- Friends who are nice to me, and with whom I mostly like to spend time. They'll be gone now that I no longer work there.

When I gave my order to the Olimpi-bro, I could feel the girl in front of me's surprise. My voice reveals something that my visage doesn't: inwardness, infinite inwardness.

*Later, at Bishop*---My diary entries are pretty decent, but I will often just skip over the most important *nouvelles*. Deal with the aftermath, but not dwell or describe the event. I need more description of the world outside myself, to situate things, give a bit of context. In order for this to be a narrative, it needs more dynamism.

Right now I am sitting at Bishop \& Bagg, 1.5 pints deep. I've just finished sending emails to V-- and C--. The first, an apology, as well as an attempt at eroticism. I referred to "her" pussy; asked what she likes; tried to get explicit, to use a few of the magic words.

title: Girls at O
---

Must apply to jobs. My shoes are not working very well. In my 20s I had a lot of promise because I was coming from nothing, because I was still young. Now in my 30s, I should have built on that experience. I should have built on those connections---but really I'm starting from nothing. That's how it feels, anyway. Building on ruins and salted earth.

But that's all in my head. When I started working at McKiernan's, it felt like I was in way over my head. It felt like there was no way that I could make it work---but I settled in, I found the confidence. It was working. They wanted to keep me on. I'm *good* at this job: we Scorpios are born to work in service.

The guy at the rally yesterday said "I love you even more [for carrying the Irish flag]," the implication being that he already loved me just for being there. It felt great to be part of something---even if I am not technically associated with Ireland, other than in virtue of my whiteness.

Beautiful women surround me at O. The one on the right is French, is here with her boyfriend; beyond her is some British blonde with a Trader Joe's tote. When I heard her accent, I thought she was making a joke because of how much she sounds like Michael Caine.

To my left is a girl studying theology. Can't tell if it's her or the other one sending voice memos. Sure sign of a crush---I can't imagine doing that with a casual friend---except that I have done it with C--...and J-- leaves me voicemails (I've never understood why).

What do I have to offer women? Society? Nothing but a terrible time.

K-- talks to me. Last time he sent me a photo of me without talking to me. This time he was doing some fake Italian bullshit (he's Portuguese). He doesn't appreciate me or my flakiness. Calls me a flake, loudly, to my face. Fair enough. Feels like I just got beat up.

"Weird is a nice way of putting it," he says when I repeat his words back at him. How can I tell him that I don't have the spine to do freelance work?

I should send him what I have. It's the least I could do, and I did a good job. I'm not stable enough, emotionally or financially, to be self-employed.

title: The Most Popular Haircut
---

Crazy night last night with D-- and M--. They---oh, there goes my focus...Back at the green lacquer bar. Fired. No job, no obligations, nothing to do but sit around in this cafe. Should apply for a job, of course---that's the only obligation I have. Otherwise I'm not doing anything. Even now, just repeating the same stupid phrase over and over.

This cafe is different. The people here are more professional (clients). At O, it's all neighbourhood bros and students. It's not as comfortable to sit at this bar: I prefer the window at O above all. Nothing like having the view of the neighbourhood, being surrounded by beautiful women. Here, I can see the same platinum blonde that works at Salle, who I see at the gym sometimes. Brighter colours. D-- one of those people who stops and talks to everyone along the way. I know a few people---remembered C--'s name. I really appreciate him asking mine. It was honest, and more respectful than not bothering, than wallowing in ambiguity.

That's enough diary. Here at PR, around 11am on a Sunday. Aimless and purposeless. Feel like my friends at Reservoir have definitely forgotten about me. I---

*White Wall Studios*

How do we trace the body---from hooking up and hanging out at the bar, to marching for Palestine?

The most popular haircut these days is a mullet, with a harsh line carved above the ears.

title: I Must Cut Down the Narrative of my Body
---

In the *Beneath Language* story, all the stuff about being adjacent to the customers is extra. There might be something there, since it's adjacent to a body---it's in the narrative of my body. Whatever that means...

...but it's extra. I need to cut it down. Make it sound better. Less repetitive, more structured. More of the imagery. Make it make more sense. Make sure the reader can follow.

Somehow, this afternoon coffee has made me feel worse.

title: Nothing is an Excuse for Writing
---

Woke up sneezing sick. No energy, no motivation. Felt like I got everything out yesterday: enough of an effort with the writing for class, with the interview, meeting D--, etc that I am excused in a break: the interview excuses my break from looking for a job; the writing excuses my break from writing; being sick excuses me from going to the gym.

Nothing is an excuse for writing. If I don't write, I won't just die---I will not exist.

V-- compared me to the Seducer in Kierkegaard's *Diary of a Seducer*. Not really, but said that she wonders if I am developing a "science" of women. Conducting experiments is very much in the vein of the seducer. What the foolish woman fails to grasp is that I am merely making observations, not conducting experiments. The possibility of *naive love* is over: that's what I lost with R--. Now I'm objectively jaded. Had to happen sooner or later.

What am I going to talk to E-- about? It's not worth applying to SSHRC for Western, because it's fully-funded and I only get 3 slots. Those need to be: Concordia Creative Writing; UBC Creative Writing; McGill? Guelph?

What else? Not much, dear diary. I need to get my nutrients in.

- garlic
- parsley
- celery
- thyme
- milk
- coconut water
- green tea

Always feels harder than normal to be somewhere without wanting to talk. But I love a cup of coffee: hot, bitter, mellowed out to a nice tan with some milk.

Can I get away with using Glissant as the source of my Indigenous cosmology?

- Architecture is more metaphysical than other media?

title: Notes on Mounds
---

If we are going to discuss Indigenous philosophy, we should also discuss written versus oral language. For Glissant, this is at the heart of the conflict between the colonizer and the colonized.

Monuments are a means to facilitate inter/intra-tribal social/economic/ideological organization. They are sites of liturgy, i.e. public ritual; they use repetitive models that are easy to understand. Their construction depends on co-operation that implies complex micro- and macro-societies.

These monuments are ritual sites that hold sacred objects, as well as food. People lived on-site sometimes. Monuments mark local resources, and people were expected to regularly return to the site. (111--112)

title: Immanent Critique of *The Exorcist III*
---

If a tree falls in a forest and no-one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Immanent critique of *The Exorcist III*: The guy looks too old to be the lead in a horror-action film. But that's a generalized category already.

So much left unsaid: the nature of the possession; most of the horrible killings happen off-screen. But if I say that it's "more" or "less" of anything, then I am comparing it to other things. Not immanent enough.

The plot follows a cop investigating a series of murders attached to the "Gemini killer," who was caught and executed years ago. The priest who jumps out the window in the first *Exorcist* film is now ambiguously played by two actors, and claims responsibility for the new murders---despite being locked up in a straight waistcoat in a rubber room.

Our protagonist is at the end of his rope. He's too old and unhealthy-looking for such a role. He's constantly losing his temper, yelling and screaming at anyone who happens to present the slightest friction in his quest.

The final scene of the film is powerful. A priest tries to perform an exorcism on a man in the padded room, but his Bible is torn to pieces by an invisible force. He flung upward and pressed to the ceiling. Peeling away, his skin and flesh stick to the padded surface, revealing the gory striations of muscle underneath.

The cop bursts in, gun drawn. He doesn't see the priest bleeding in the corner. He confronts the killer, who keeps referring to himself in the plural---as though he were "legion." His motivation seems to be to make the cop "believe."

Pinned to the wall by an unseen power, arms parallel to the floor as though crucified, he rasps---*I believe...in depravity, in scum, in unspeakable things*, listing a litany of terrible things. Did the Devil hope he would come to believe in God so that he could take it away from him? Lightning strikes the floor, over and over inside the rubber room. Through the broken floor, arms reach up from Hell. The black boy from the beginning, face painted like in a minstrel show, silver ingots hammered through his eyes.

The cop's speech about scum and villainy is ambiguous. All these bad things seem to be the domain of the devil: is he affirming the power of the infernal powers? It seems more like the monologue functions as some kind of denial, although it's not entirely clear how. The film is ambiguous through and through.

Finally, the possessed priest momentarily gains control of his body; the cop blows his brains out, the devil is deprived of a vessel, and evil is vanquished.

***

Why do I feel so bad in this room? In these classes? In all classes? Too much baggage. I should do an immanent critique of me in this class.

Immanent critique of the hospital bombing. In what sense is it real? A bunch of children and injured people, the known defenseless were killed.

I learned new chants at the rally on Sunday. We showed up at Dorchester Square to learn them before the march. We were led by a voice that came from somewhere out in the sea of people. They spread, and we went slowly on the march. It was raining, but not too bad. The umbrellas added to the atmosphere of collectivity.

Wake up feeling terrible. Halloween is one year. What progress have I made? Had sex with three girls, all of whom I feel are beneath me. I'm just as alone as ever. I am making no progress on actually finding my own way in the world. This is not to mention the professional woes---no job, no job, a deadbeat!

Girl next to me is reading *Frankenstein*. I'm doing nothing. I have good strength and rigorous technique. I'm muscular, at least.

There is that idea in *Cave of Forgotten Dreams* that societies and cultures that do not have writing live outside of history; ten thousand years is the same as a single rotation of the moon.

*creation story* <--> *architecture* <--> *time* / Thanksgiving

The theme of Thanksgiving is the significant part that's still missing. A paragraph at the beginning and end where I speak in the first person. I say *my* relation to the topics at hand; my relationship to colonialism and whiteness. It's my place to say what and who I am thankful for. Something sincere and real. Break form.

At F. New guy is talking about Ezra Pound with one of his regular--friends. I have a training shift for a full-time job as a server. The indent of the saucer where the cup sits is filthy; the bottom of the cup is filthy because the grill of the espresso machine is filthy. Despite this details, I will concede that the milk is perfect Italian-style foam.

Right now, the goal is very modest. It's 11:43 am; if I say until 12:45, I can be on the gym floor by 1, then hopefully out by 3pm. Go home just long enough to drop off things, then bike to the new job. Bring book + notebook, and afterwards---you are permitted to get a drink.

title: It's the Question of Everything
---

Everything is hopeless. No prospects. Everything going downhill.

Working on *Morning Regrets* now, because I feel very emotional and that's all I have.

The key to making this story interesting is to play up the sense of the Block. The reason this character couldn't talk to the girl at the party is actually something very Epic---something high-concept. It's the question of everything. Fictional. Not quotidian.

Hallucinatory. Vision goes black and white. Hearing things, seeing things. Put some more ghosts in there. Skin the cat.

All this writing does is depress me.

Trying to take a crack at the Western application. By God, it's all impossible, LOL!

UWO and Concordia are now the main ones, because S--'s endorsement makes me think maybe I actually have a chance.

What else. The weekend has been immensely depressing and lonely. The calendar is an undifferentiated stretch of loneliness. For my birthday this year, I will have no-one to go to the spa with, no-one to go to dinner with. The season is already almost over. No-one cares---it doesn't matter---C-- is probably dead---I might as well kill myself, no-one would care. My hope is to just drown it all out---if I can sublimate my own unhappiness into a creative project, be one of those artists who makes one intense, juvenile work that cuts close to the bone, rather than the kind of artist with a diverse body of work; well, I'll take it.

title: Working for Zionists
---

Saw the very cute girl that I saw here at O several months ago---a few times, even. Here---yesterday, at Pigeon. Didn't talk to her. Too cowardly. She has nice rosy cheeks and a round face. [She was studying something related to theology](/blog#2023-10-14). Very cool, but it's a bad sign that she's at the Israeli restaurant right now.

And that's the other thing, dear diary: I get a job, and of course they're on a BDS list, LOL! My life is a joke. I feel paranoid there. It sucks. Palestine pin on my jacket, keffiyah around my neck. WTF. I'm gonna get fired, and just when I thought I could relax.

The goal is diffuse today. Don't have much of one. I won't return to the APCON essay until Thursday, earliest. I should work on *Beneath Language*, but am not feeling it. What I am feeling is the *Morning* story, which has good parts---I swear to God, there's something there....

The first several paragraphs are decent. One of my ideas for it is to just make it "realistic," i.e. not about anything; or do we prefer instead to make it less realistic, about a guy who is hallucinating? That feels like a conventional twist, but that's a good thing: it's recognizable, and therefore I don't have to work as hard.

The other idea was "campus noir," use a lot of PI tropes, hard-boiled tropes, to develop a "mystery" of existential despair. "Who killed my reason for living," etc. This is a distinctly terrible idea.

title: Notes on *Morning Regrets*
---

The story becomes something else when it moves into a closer analysis of class society (the Hegel class's society). The problem is that it's disconnected. If we can get it to the point where it's doing a serviceable job of describing the characters and social dynamics, then I can add in---more hallucinations? We need something to bring us back to the morning of waking up.

Okay, here's the plot: you put her name into the computer once, twice, and on the third her name swims into view. That's the magic element. That's the story of the morning. It ends with us engaging in a dialogue. Fantasy, or banal reality? I think an anti-climactic ("realistic") ending gives us a better shot of ending on a joke.

- Wake up depressed
- Remember the party from night prior
- External dynamics of the Hegel class
- Discussion of sense-certainty with J-- and E--
- V--, guilt and shame
- Internal dynamics of the Hegel class

We need a better structure for moving through time. More needs to happen on the first day. Everything else is a recollection. The morning and that day is the story's present. We need two more events. Our theme is ritual \& lack thereof, so one event can be work related: in that moment, you, our hero, is in the limbo at the end of classes, before graduation, and without a job. That is about when I would be doing my first trial shift at R. Maybe in a desperate moment before work, I enter her name into the computer for the second time.

1. The first is in bed, when you're unable to move
2. The second is before work, when you're feeling completely useless
3. The third is before bed, when you're buzzed?

That's basically enough of a plot. Are we making him some kind of hallucinatory guy? We don't need to insert noir tropes, fuck, but we still need some kind of hook. The hook is whether or not she actually *did* recognize him in the same way that he recognized her; whether or not he's crazy, projecting, or if he's correctly reading her affect.

As an epilogue, we can talk about seeing her at the reading and constantly moving to keep a distance. Then, seeing her and the Lil' Peep BF out the window. Basically, despite the rejection, there is still this unknowability (opacity); still an element of Schrodinger's love affair. But we have to put this into relation, or into Hegelian terms. The actual and the virtual.

It's fantasy to think that there is a possibility of things continuing. The story ends after finding her online, on an unambiguous note of rejection. Not cruel, just real. Maybe when you look in the mirror, you see someone else. You don't know---you can never know whether the Other recognized you in that brief [flash of the eye](/blog#2023-09-08), but it's possible!

title: A Good Opportunity
---

What to do...! How am I going to talk to the girl next door...I can offer to give back the papers---then I can ask, well, say that I was so wasted the other night, I could barely speak---but it was so nice to talk to her, to learn a bit about her---it was the nicest birthday gift of all. It felt like God smiled on me; it felt like the clouds parted, and an angel floated down on a lunar beam. Not just because she is a smiling, cheerful beauty; but because *something happened*. From out of the chaos and turmoil of the world, from out of the constant, impersonal movement of the city, a figure coheres and emerges. I want to learn more about her. 

My *Thanksgiving* essay was rejected by APCON, and I will say that it feels terrible. That and not having a job have got me feeling very stressed. Worried. *Failure*.

Who else publishes weird little philosophy essays? Who can I send this to? Don't let it go to waste---it needs to go somewhere---a proper literary journal---this is a good opportunity---but it's not important right now. The essay is bad, after all, and it's good that it isn't published, because it doesn't cut the mustard. Instead, I need to apply to some jobs.

Here I am at Cafe D, back in this pit of raw concrete, and the tall beauty that I asked so many people to help me find is here. Will I have the courage to approach her? After having hyped it up so much? I can't ask her out right now, I can't---no way.

What is my plan? Walk back up St-Laurent to the package store; then to Popeye's, then to---various bars along Mont-Royal?

I'm frozen on this bench. It's not even a proper table, more like a staging ground, but I can't move. Too afraid to approach her, and too afraid to leave without approaching her. Maybe I should just stay here forever. My old boss, G--, just walked by---what a prick. Man I am stressed out right now.

title: Everyone has the Advantage
---

Unbelievably depressed this morning. No hope. I am a complete failure. Nothing but failure. No hope. I have to get on welfare. No woman ever again. Nothing. I am nothing, I will never be anything. I am a failure. I am a total failure. I give up, I give up. It's hopeless. Fail, constant fail, never-ending fail. Rejection without end; rejection on rejection. Inescapable loop, stuck forever. Nothing will get better, everything will always get worse. No prospects, just nothing for ever and ever. Failures pile up, I am alone, I will always be alone, I will be alone forever, alone with my failures. Nothing but a dark void of hopelessness and failure. Nothing to look forward to. I feel bad that my cat and my roommates have to suffer my presence; I would never dare, I would never presume to inflict my presence on a woman.

Everyone has the advantage. I have the disadvantage. I am a fucking failure. I should KMS.

title: Birthday Failures
---

The party itself was a failure. Many of the people who said they would attend didn't; there were a few new friends, but attendance in general was down from last year's Christmas party, my high watermark. The food was there unexpectedly, the cookies greeted with a more familiar care.

A moment of joy came at the end of the night, but it will only turn out to be another failure. Coming back from the bar after last call, I ran into the upstairs neighbour. Beautiful and cheerful, she felt safe enough to come inside at 4am for a smoke. Told me that her old roommate with the dog named Olive had a crush on me. Her name is C--, and she appeared like a joyful ray from out of a dark sky. Warm, cheerful, bubbly, cute. I was too wasted to make an impression---could barely slur together a few limp questions to try to learn a bit more about her.

For 24 cold and delirious hours, I was riding high on a memory as thought it were winged like Pegasus. 15 minutes is enough to fuel a lifetime. The next morning, I got a rejection letter from APCON. When I knocked on the door to deploy my Trojan horse (a pack of rolling papers), the blonde answered; and as usual she seemed grumpy, unhappy to be disturbed. But who likes when a stranger knocks on their door?

title: The Ecstasy of Optimism
---

A bit of encouragement from the world hits the brain like a chemical injection. The ecstasy of optimism. A good lead, a possibility: an interview that went well, at a restaurant and for a *patron* that I recognize as being at the level of service that I am used to. *Hope*. Hits like an amazing drug. Light, buoyant. It feels like I'm floating on air. There's a storm-cloud, which is the fact that I haven't even done a trial shift. They have infinite options. Still: when I left, I rushed around the corner, fell to me knees on the asphalt lot there, faced east and the low fence of a socialized housing block, and said a prayer.

My Concordia letter of application needs a section on the diversity of my academic knowledge, etc. This should go into the part where I talk about---my genre. How my genre is informed by my background. I'm trying to bring together a wide range of different knowledges to develop one *very cool* practise.

The Western letter needs to reference some of their faculty---that's the main piece missing.

title: The Most Insane Rationalization I Have Ever Indulged In
---

Two days since I gave my number to the girl upstairs. I paced the landing where our two doors let out for ten minutes before J-- knocked for me. When she opened, she was wearing a silk robe and a headscarf; she saw me and looked down at herself as though to say, *well, this is how you have found me, and?* I didn't know what to say---it was one of those comedic moments where the head empties itself and at the crucial moment, all my Works decay, and "Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away." [^1] She won't be in touch. I know, because to do so would be too active for the feminine; and, in being an explicit admission of interest, it would negate her power. When I told her that it was nice to talk to her, she agreed, and I believed her...I believe her now. But she has other things to do; she is not going to be so forthright in signalling her interest. She can't---structurally, logically. It makes no rational sense. If she calls me, if she texts me, that would be her activity. She is a woman---she is not going to be the active one, and nor should she. It would undermine her femininity, and she's very feminine; it would be a weak move, and she's not weak. I don't even want her to: I want her to signal passively that she is interested, but I want to be the one to initiate things because, after all, I am a man.

[^1]: Shelley, *Ozymandias*. [Accessed online](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias).

Of course she is not going to call me. The entire structure of civilization---no, but *physis* itself is against us: it's not merely that we are neighbours, and therefore there is an inherent risk...but all our meetings are contingent on admitting attraction. I thought there was some admission of attraction when she came into the apartment at 4am and told me her friend had a crush on me---but there remains some plausible deniability. At this stage, it would only work to move things along by "accident." That is the most frustrating aspect of dating: everything must appear "accidental," as though there are no stakes involved.

I honestly can't tell if it's me or the world. I always feel the need for a subterfuge. There needs to be something else---some excuse. A woman will not simply *agree* to go out with me, just as one does not simply walk into Mordor. She will not simply *admit* that she is attracted to me, will not concede that she wants to know me and be known by me. There needs to be a pretense---a network of excuses, justifications; because otherwise, she makes herself vulnerable. And why would she, to a stranger? It's quite frustrating, but I understand it. What I don't quite understand is how to transcend. This whole discussion is upsetting to me. A woman knows that I am an attractive guy; we have plenty in common---she knows that we work in the same industry, etc. There's a lot of compatibility. She saw the books, the TV, the red flag, the nice apartment: she knows that I have tastes and interests and probably feels some curiosity to know more about me---just like I am curious to know about her...but life is conspiring to keep us apart.
