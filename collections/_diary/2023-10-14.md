title: Girls at O
---

## Saturday {.chapter-subsection}

I need to hit the pavement and apply to jobs, but my shoes aren't working very well. In my 20s I had a lot of promise because I was coming from nothing, because I was still young. Now in my 30s, the expectation is that I would have built on that experience. I should have built on those connections---but here I am, building on ruins and salted earth.

The guy at the rally yesterday said "I love you even more [for carrying the Irish flag]," the implication being that he already loved me just for being there. It felt great to be part of something---even if I am just another imposter under cover of whiteness.

Beautiful women surround me at O. The one on the right is French, is here with her boyfriend; beyond her is some British blonde with a Trader Joe's tote, a classic sign of West Coast Americana. When I heard her accent, I thought she was doing a bit because of how much she sounds like Michael Caine.

To my left is a girl studying theology. Can't tell if it's her or the other one sending voice memos. Sure sign of a crush---I can't imagine doing that with a casual friend---except that I have done it with C--...and J-- leaves me voicemail (I've never understood why).

K-- talks to me. Last time he saw me here, he sent me a photo of myself like a serial killer, but did not bother me. This time he was doing some fake Italian bullshit (he's Portuguese, maybe it's the same). He doesn't "appreciate" me or my flakiness. Calls me a flake, brashly, to my face. Fair enough. Feels like I just got beat up.

"Weird is a nice way of putting it," he says when I repeat his words back at him. How can I tell him that I don't have the spine to do freelance work? That I hate doing "knowledge work" more than anything?

I should send him what I have. It's the least I could do, and I did a good job. I'm not stable enough, emotionally or financially, to be self-employed.

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Crazy night last night with D-- and M--. They...oh, there goes my focus...Back at the green lacquer bar. Fired. No job, no obligations, nothing to do but sit around in this cafe. Should apply for a job, of course---that's the only obligation I have. Otherwise I'm not doing anything. Even now, brain too fuzzy to come up with an original phrase, so I just repeat the same thing over and over.

This cafe is different. The people here are more professional (clients). At O, it's all neighbourhood bros and students. It's not as comfortable to sit at this bar: I prefer the window at O above all. Nothing like having the view of the neighbourhood, being surrounded by beautiful women. Here, I can see the same platinum blonde that works at SC, who does her hip thrusts in the morning at the Y. D-- one of those people who, on a night out, stops and talks to everyone along the way. I know a few people---at the buvette, I remembered C--'s name. I really appreciate him asking mine. It was honest more respectful than just not bothering.

That's enough diary. Here at PR, around 11am on a Sunday. Aimless and purposeless. Feel like my friends at Reservoir have definitely forgotten about me. I---

*White Wall Studios*

How do we trace the body---from hooking up and hanging out at the bar, to marching for Palestine?

The most popular haircut these days is a mullet, with a harsh line carved above the ears.

title: I Must Cut Down the Narrative of my Body
---

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

In the *Beneath Language* story, all the stuff about being adjacent to the customers is extra. There might be something there, since it's adjacent to a body---it's in the narrative of my body. Whatever that means...

...but it's extra. I need to cut it down. Make it sound better. Less repetitive, more structured. More of the imagery. Make it make more sense. Make sure the reader can follow.

Somehow, this afternoon coffee has made me feel worse.

title: Nothing is an Excuse for Writing
---

## Wednesday {.chapter-subsection}

Woke up sneezing sick. No energy, no motivation. Felt like I got everything out yesterday: enough of an effort with the writing for class, with the interview, meeting D--, etc that I am excused in a break. The interview excuses my break from looking for a job; the writing excuses my break from writing; being sick excuses me from going to the gym.

Nothing is an excuse for writing. If I don't write, I will evaporate instantly.

V-- compared me to the Seducer in Kierkegaard's *Diary of a Seducer*. She wonders if I am developing a "science" of women. Conducting experiments is very much in the vein of the Seducer. *What the foolish woman fails to grasp is that I am merely making observations, not conducting experiments!* The possibility of *naive love* is over: that's what I lost with R--. Now I'm jaded. Loved too much. Had to happen sooner or later.

What else? Not much, dear diary. I need to get my nutrients in.

- garlic
- parsley
- celery
- thyme
- milk
- coconut water
- green tea

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Always feels harder than normal to be somewhere without wanting to talk. But I love a cup of coffee: hot, bitter, mellowed-out to a nice tan with some milk.

Can I get away with using Glissant as the source of my Indigenous cosmology?

- Mound Builders
- Architecture as cosmology?
- Architecture is more metaphysical than other media?

If we are going to discuss Indigenous philosophy, we should also discuss written versus oral language. For Glissant, this is at the heart of the conflict between the colonizer and the colonized.

Monuments are a means to facilitate inter/intra-tribal social/economic/ideological organization. They are sites of liturgy (public ritual). They use repetitive models that are easy to understand across religious variance. Their construction depends on co-operation that implies complex micro- and macro-societies.

These monuments are ritual sites that hold sacred objects; but they're also pragmatic, functioning as food caches and waymarkers. People lived on-site (sometimes). Monuments mark local resources, and people were expected to regularly return to the site. (111--112)

*Use old-fashioned words like "league."*

title: Immanent Critique of *The Exorcist III*
---

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

If a tree falls in a forest and no-one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Immanent critique of *The Exorcist III*: The guy looks too old to be the lead in a horror-action film. Already, in identifying a genre and its norms, we are being too generalized.

So much is left unsaid in the film. Most of the horrible killings happen off-screen, for example. But if I say that it's "more" or "less" of anything, then I am comparing it to other things and being *insufficiently immanent*.

The plot follows a high-ranking police officer investigating a series of murders that are being attributed to the "Gemini killer," who was caught and executed years ago. The priest who jumps out the window in the first *Exorcist* film is now played by two actors; when wearing his new face, he claims responsibility for the new murders---despite being locked up in a rubber room wearing a straight-jacket. The murder that opens the film is of a young black boy, decapitated, silver ingots driven through his eyes.

Our protagonist is at the end of his rope. He's too old and unhealthy-looking for such an active role. He's constantly losing his temper, yelling and screaming at random characters who intrude into the film's scenes. He looks like he's about to have a heart attack.

The final scene of the film is powerful. A priest tries to perform an exorcism on the man in the padded room, but his Bible is torn to pieces by an invisible presence. He is flung upward and pressed against the ceiling. His skin and flesh stick to the padded surface, peeled away to reveal the gory striations of muscle underneath.

The cop bursts in, revolver drawn. He doesn't see the priest bleeding in the corner, and instead confronts the killer, who keeps referring to himself in the plural---as though he were some kind of royalty. His motivation is to make the cop "believe."

Pinned to the wall by an unseen power, arms parallel to the floor in the pose of crucifixion, he rasps---

> This I believe in...I believe in death. I believe in disease. I believe in injustice and inhumanity, torture and anger and hate...I believe in murder. I believe in pain. I believe in cruelty and infidelity. I believe in slime and stink and every crawling, putrid thing...every possible ugliness and corruption, you son of a bitch. I believe...in you. 

The Gemini Killer wants our secular protagonist to believe in the actuality of the Divine, to convince him of the cruelty of an order that permits all the evil he has wreaking over the course of the film. Lightning strikes the floor over and over inside the rubber room. Through the broken surface, arms reach up from the Abyss. We see the black boy from the beginning, face painted as in a minstrel show, tears of blood trickling from the silver ingots hammered through his eyes.

The cop's speech about scum and villainy is ambiguous. All these bad things seem to be the domain of the Devil/Gemini Killer. Is he affirming his loyalty to the infernal? The monologue functions as a negation through affirmation. The film is ambiguous through and through, and as we know, ambiguity leads to great aesthetic power.

Finally, the possessed priest, our "Gemini Killer," momentarily gains control of his body; the cop blows his brains out, the Devil is deprived of a vessel, and evil is vanquished.

***

Why do I feel so bad in this room? In all classrooms? Too much baggage. I should do an immanent critique of me, here, right now.

Immanent critique of the hospital bombing. In what sense is it real? A bunch of children and injured people were attacked. A strike at a building whose function is to shelter the defenseless. A war crime by international law; a moral crime by universal law.

We learned a few new chants at the rally on Sunday. We showed up at Dorchester Square to learn them before the march. We were led by a voice that came from somewhere out in the sea of people. They spread, and we went slowly on the march. It was raining, but the ceiling of umbrellas added to the atmosphere of collectivity.

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

Wake up feeling terrible. Halloween is one year. What progress have I made? Had sex with three girls, all of whom I feel are steps down. I'm just as alone as ever, making no progress on actually finding my own way in the world. This is not to mention the professional woes---no job, no job; a deadbeat!

Girl next to me is reading *Frankenstein*. I'm doing nothing. I have good strength and pretty good technique. Some muscles, at least.

There is that idea in *Cave of Forgotten Dreams* that societies and cultures that do not have writing live outside of history; ten thousand years is the same as a single rotation of the moon.

*creation story* <--> *architecture* <--> *time* / Thanksgiving

The theme of Thanksgiving is the significant part that's still missing. A paragraph at the beginning and end where I speak in the first person. I say *my* relation to the topics at hand; my relationship to colonialism and whiteness. It's my place to say what and who I am thankful for. Something sincere and real. Break form.

title: Perfect Italian-style Foam
---

## Thursday {.chapter-subsection}

At F. New guy is talking about Ezra Pound with one of his regulars. I already didn't like his attitude or look. I have a training shift for a full-time job as a server. The indent of the saucer where the cup sits is filthy; the bottom of the cup is filthy because the grill of the espresso machine is filthy. Despite this detail, I will concede that the milk is perfect Italian-style foam.

Right now, the goal is very modest. It's 11:43 am; if I stay here until 12:45, I can be on the gym floor by 1, then hopefully out by 3pm. Go home just long enough to drop off things, then bike to the new job. Bring book + notebook, and afterwards---you are permitted to get a drink.

title: It's the Question of Everything
---

## Saturday {.chapter-subsection}

Everything is hopeless. No prospects. Everything going downhill.

Working on *Morning Regrets* now, because I feel very emotional and that's all I have.

The key to making this story interesting is to play up the sense of the Block. The reason this character couldn't talk to the girl at the party is actually something very Epic---something high-concept. It's the question of everything. Fictional. Not quotidian.

Hallucinatory. Vision goes black and white. Hearing things, seeing things. Put some more ghosts in there. Kick the cat. Skin the cat.

All this writing does is depress me.

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Taking a crack at the Western application. By God, it's all impossible, LOL!

UWO and Concordia are now the main ones, because S--'s endorsement makes me think maybe I actually have a chance.

What else. The weekend has been immensely depressing and lonely. The calendar is an undifferentiated stretch of loneliness. For my birthday this year, I will have no-one to go to the spa with, no-one to go to dinner with. The season is already almost over. No-one cares---it doesn't matter---C-- is probably dead---I might as well join him in Hell, where at least someone will be glad to see me. My hope is to just drown it all out---if I can sublimate my own unhappiness into a creative project, be one of those artists who makes one intense, juvenile work that cuts close to the bone. I always fancied myself the kind of artist capable of producing a diverse body of work, pieces both intellectual and creative. I'll take whatever I can get because, in reality, I'm nothing.

title: Working for Zionists

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

Saw the very cute girl that I saw at O several months ago. Didn't talk to her. Too cowardly. She has nice rosy cheeks and a round face. [She was studying something related to theology](/blog#2023-10-14). A domain that I respect, but it's a bad sign that she's at the Israeli restaurant.

And that's the other thing, dear diary: I get a job, and of course they're on a BDS list, LOL! My life is a joke. I feel paranoid there. It sucks. Palestine pin on my jacket, keffiyah around my neck. I'm going to be fired, and just when I thought I could relax.

The goal is diffuse today. Don't have much of one. I won't return to the APCON essay until Thursday, earliest. I should work on *Beneath Language*, but am not feeling it. What I am feeling is the *Morning* story, which has good parts---I swear to God, there's something there.

The first several paragraphs are decent. One of my ideas for it is to just make it "realistic," i.e. not about anything; or do we prefer instead to make it less realistic, about a guy who is hallucinating? That feels like a conventional twist, but that's a good thing: it's recognizable, and therefore I don't have to work as hard.

The other idea was "campus noir." Use a lot of PI tropes, hard-boiled tropes, to develop a "mystery" of existential despair. "Who killed my reason for living," etc. This is a profoundly terrible idea.

title: Notes on *Morning Regrets*
---

## Thursday {.chapter-subsection}

The story becomes something else when it moves into a closer analysis of class society (the Hegel class's society). The problem is that it's disconnected. If we can get it to the point where it's doing a serviceable job of describing the characters and social dynamics, then I can add in---more hallucinations? We need something to bring us back to the morning where the narrative begins.

Okay, here's the plot: you put her name into the computer once, twice, and on the third her name swims into view. That's the magic element. That's the story of the morning. It ends with us engaging in a dialogue. Fantasy, or banal reality? I think an anti-climactic ("realistic") ending gives us a better shot of ending on a joke.

- Wake up depressed
- Remember the party from night prior
- External dynamics of the Hegel class
- Discussion of sense-certainty with J-- and E--
- V--, guilt and shame
- Internal dynamics of the Hegel class

We need a better structure for moving through time. More needs to happen on the first day. Everything else is a recollection. The morning and that day is the story's present. We need two more events. Our theme is ritual \& lack thereof, so one event can be work related: in that moment, you, our hero, are in the limbo at the end of classes, before graduation, without a job. That is about when I would be doing my first trial shift at R. Maybe in a desperate moment before work, I enter her name into the computer for the second time.

1. The first is in bed, when you're unable to move
2. The second is before work, when you're feeling completely useless
3. The third is before bed, when you're buzzed?

That's basically enough of a plot. Are we making him some kind of hallucinatory guy? The hook is whether or not she actually *did* recognize him in the same way that he recognized her; whether or not he's crazy, projecting, or if he's correctly reading her affect.

As an epilogue, we can talk about seeing her at the reading and constantly moving to keep a distance. Then, seeing her and the Lil' Peep BF out the window. Basically, despite the rejection, there is still this unknowability (opacity); still an element of Schrodinger's love affair. But we have to put this into relation, or into Hegelian terms. The actual and the virtual.

It's fantasy to think that there is a possibility of things continuing. The story ends after finding her online, on an unambiguous note of rejection. Not cruel, because she wasn't; just real. Maybe when you look in the mirror, you see someone else. You don't know---you can never know whether the Other recognized you in that brief [flash of the eye](/blog#2023-09-08), but it's possible!

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

What to do...! How am I going to talk to the girl next door...I can offer to give back the papers---then I can say...I was so wasted the other night, I could barely speak---but it was so nice to talk to [you], to learn a bit about [you]---it was the nicest birthday gift of all. It felt like God smiled on me; it felt like the clouds parted, and an angel floated down on a crepuscular moonbeam. Not just because she is a smiling, cheerful beauty; but because *something happened*. From out of the chaos and turmoil of the world, from out of the constant, impersonal movement of the city, a figure clarifies and emerges. Vibrations become corporeal. I want to learn more about her. 

My *Thanksgiving* essay was rejected by APCON, and I will say that it feels terrible. That and not having a job have got me feeling very stressed. Worried. *Failure*.

Who else publishes weird little philosophy essays? Who can I send this to? Don't let it go to waste---it needs to go somewhere---a proper literary journal---this is a good opportunity---but it's not important right now. The essay is bad, after all, and it's good that it won't be published in its current form, because it would be a stain on my record. Most of my portfolio does not hold up. Instead of worrying about this bullshit, I need to apply to some jobs.

## Monday {.chapter-subsection}

Here I am at Cafe D, back in this pit of raw concrete, and the tall beauty that I asked so many people to help me find is here. I had to track down C-- just to get her name, with which I did nothing. Will I have the courage to approach her? After having hyped it up so much? I can't ask her out right now, I can't. She will immediately perceive how fucked up I am.

What is my plan? Walk back up St-Laurent to the package store; then to Popeye's, then to---various bars along Mont-Royal?

I'm frozen on this bench. It's not even a proper table, more like a staging ground; and yet I can't move. Too afraid to approach her, and too afraid to leave without approaching her. Maybe I should just stay here forever. G-- from R just walked by---what a prick. Man I am stressed out.

title: Everyone has the Advantage

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

Unbelievably depressed this morning. No hope, nothing but failure. No hope. I should get back on welfare. I will never have a woman again. Nothing. I am nothing, I will never be anything. I am a failure. I am a total failure. I give up. It's hopeless. I give up. Fail, constant failure, never-ending failure. Rejection without end; rejection compounds rejection. An inescapable loop that I will be stuck in forever. Nothing will get better, everything will always get worse. No prospects, just nothing for ever and ever. Failures pile up, I am alone, I will always be alone, I will be alone forever, alone with my failures. Nothing but a dark void of hopelessness and failure. Nothing to look forward to. I feel bad that my cat and my roommates have to suffer my presence. I would never dare, I would never presume to inflict my presence on an intimate relation.

Everyone has the advantage. I have the disadvantage. Top of the privilege pyramid, yet I still manage to squander my privilege. I am a failure. As such, the wise thing to do would be to end it now.

title: Birthday Failures
---

## Thursday {.chapter-subsection}

The party itself was a failure. Many of the people who said they would attend didn't; there were a few new friends, but attendance in general was down from last year's Christmas party, my high watermark. The food was unexpected and greeted without relish. The cookies, despite all having the same texture, were sweet and buttery enough to get snapped up.

A moment of joy came at the end of the night, but it will only turn out to be another failure. Coming back from the bar after last call, I ran into the upstairs neighbour. Beautiful and cheerful, she felt safe enough to come inside at 4am for a smoke. Told me that her old roommate with the dog named Olive had a crush on me. Her name is C--, and she appeared like a joyful ray from out of a dark sky. Warm, cheerful, bubbly, cute. I was too wasted to make an impression---could barely slur together a few limp questions to try to learn a bit more about her.

For 24 cold and delirious hours, I was riding high on a memory as thought it were winged like Pegasus. 15 minutes is enough fuel for days---we'll see how long. The next morning, I got a rejection letter from APCON. When I knocked on the door to deploy my Trojan horse (a pack of rolling papers), the blonde answered; and as usual she seemed grumpy, unhappy to be disturbed. But who likes when a stranger knocks on their door?

title: The Ecstasy of Optimism

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

A bit of encouragement from the world hits the brain like a chemical injection. The ecstasy of optimism. A good lead, a possibility: an interview that went well, at a nice little restaurant, for an employer whose standards I recognize as being at least on par with my own. *Hope*. Hits like an amazing drug. Light and buoyant. It feels like I'm floating on air. Of course there's a storm-cloud, which is the fact that I have not so much as done a trial shift. He has infinite options, just like she does. Still: when I left, I rushed around the corner and fell to me knees on the asphalt. Facing Mecca and the low metal fence of socialized housing block, I said a prayer of thanks.

My Concordia letter of application needs a section on the diversity of my academic knowledge. This should go into the part where I talk about---my genre. How my genre is informed by my background. I'm trying to bring together a wide range of different knowledges to develop one *very cool* practise.

The Western letter is missing references to their faculty, but otherwise it's done.

Infatuated with anyone who pays attention. I "don't like to talk about myself." I try to remain mysterious, and I'm proud of this feminine trait.

title: The Most Insane Rationalization I Have Ever Indulged In
---

## Wednesday {.chapter-subsection}

Two days since I gave my number to the girl upstairs. I paced the landing where our two doors let out for ten minutes before J-- knocked for me. When she opened, she was wearing a silk robe and a headscarf; she saw me and looked down at herself as though to say, *well, this is how you have found me; and?* I didn't know what to say---it was one of those comedic moments where the head empties itself. At the crucial moment, all my Works decay, and "Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away." [^1] She won't be in touch. I know, because to do so would be too active for the feminine. It would be an explicit admission of interest, and would thereby negate the feminine power of mystery. I know the power of mystery very well. When I told her that it was nice to talk to her, she agreed, and I believed her...I believe her now. But she has other things to do. She is not going to be so forthright in signalling her interest. She can't---structurally, logically. It makes no rational sense. If she calls me, if she texts me, that would be her activity. She is a woman---she is not going to be the active one, and nor should she. It would be a weak, un-lady-like move, and she's not weak. I don't even want her to: I want her to signal passively that she is interested, but I want to be the one to initiate things. After all, I'm a man.

[^1]: Shelley, *Ozymandias*. [Accessed online](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias).

Of course she is not going to call me. The entire structure of civilization---no, but φύσις (*physis*) itself is against us. It's not merely that we are neighbours, and therefore there is an inherent risk...but all our meetings are contingent on admitting attraction. I thought there was some admission of attraction when she came into the apartment at 4am and told me her friend had a crush on me---but there remains some plausible deniability. At this stage, it would only work to move things along by "accident." That is the most frustrating aspect of dating: everything must appear "accidental," as though there are no stakes involved.

I can't tell if it's me or the world. I always feel the need for a subterfuge. There needs to be some *excuse*. A woman will not simply *agree* to go out with me, just as one does not simply *walk* into Mordor. She will not simply *admit* that she is attracted to me, will not concede that she wants to know me and be known by me. There needs to be a pretense---a network of excuses, justifications; because otherwise, she makes herself vulnerable. And why would she make herself vulnerable to a stranger? It's quite frustrating, but I understand it. What I don't quite understand is how to transcend. This whole discussion is upsetting to me. A woman knows that I am an attractive guy; we have plenty in common. There's a lot of compatibility. She saw the books, the TV, the red flag, the nice apartment: she knows that I have tastes and interests and probably feels some curiosity to know more about me---just like I am curious to know about her...but "human society is an anti-physis." [@beauvoir2011, 94]
