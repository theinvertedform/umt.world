title: A Home for Wayward Boys
---

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

A home for wayward boys, but the plot of land it's on emits a permanent stink....

My sister goes to the bar and knows everyone. I go to the bar and am alone---surrounded, yes, by a vague *connaissance* of many people, but I remain alone.

A girl I spoke to once looks away awkwardly. I must look really bad. I must smell bad. My pheromones are rank. My aura gives off invisible stink lines.

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Apply at Concordia. Send pitches for the Wolfgang review. Read Gravity's Rainbow. Read Hegel. Go to the gym. Figure something out with the money. Apply for a few more jobs. 

At what point during all of this am I going to find a wife? Where's the progress there? Instead, I sublimate my desire into the gym, into this diary. If I can't be happy, at least I can be a jacked artist. Bring the weight on. I want to press a plate overhead!

title: E--'s First Class of the Semester
---

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

In the VA lunchroom before E--'s first class of the semester. Lights low, plastic furniture, only a few scared-looking art students. The question weighing on me right now is, how am I going to keep writing after the inspiration of the APCON piece? I can't lose momentum. I need to be sending out pitches---multiple every day; for the Wolfgang review, for whatever. Publish it anywhere, so long as it's somewhere (other than here).

We need to finish *Morning Regrets*. It needs to be an actual story. That means an ending, which means *change*. A guy who imagines that religiosity would fill the void.

*Later*---This class is a sausage fest. More than usual for E--'s classes. Being in a strange room, next to the queen mother (E--): it feels very overwhelming. I wonder if I belong here---based on how many other guys there are, the answer seems to be yes.

title: On the *via negativa*
---

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

My goal right now is to respond to V--'s email, and to send the pitch to at least one more magazine.

Can't do the latter. Difficult enough to do the former. Too distracted by thoughts of girls. The desire for love. I am not available to women. They don't know about me. I am not there. No-one cares. And they're right not to, because I'm fucking ugly. I have no friends. Loser---no-one wants you, no-one ever will.

The goal for this weekend is to pitch the Wolfgang review to at least 3 places. Emails to be sent out on Monday. Start pitching it indiscriminately: a 1k word column. That's all I want to show for it. Something short, funny, sassy, that people will want to read. Just 1000 words.

*Just before 16h*---Everything is futile. I have zero prospects. Nothing but sadness, loneliness. Life of the modern gymcel. Life of the modern man. I should go back to l'E and tell that girl the truth: that I liked the look in her eyes. I liked the way they flashed in that brief ellipsis between dodging drunks.

*'Round midnight*---Maybe if I wore more tonal outfits, like the cowboy white-hat on the couch opposite me---here, now, at CDP. Maybe if I had bigger side delts someone would love me. Maybe if I had used sunscreen in the morning for the past ten years, and my face were not so wrinkled; maybe If I were one degree higher in my profession. Maybe if I had finished that third reading of the *Phenomenology of Spirit* I would have a girlfriend.

My relationship to women is almost entirely parasocial. Few friends, few real interactions; instead, just---the hot girls I ogle at work, or while at work. Is that really better or worse than using an app? Infinite possibilities emerge out of the city. The cafe is *here*---I'm at one right now, in fact. Apps are not here: they are an added layer of mediation. We best approximate God through reduction (*via negativa*). Our communist utopia similarly requires one single change (global abolishment of class) to the network of social relations. Most importantly, happiness (wife) will be found by removing everything else in life until only she remains.

Saw E-- last week; saw J-- and her Lil' Peep boyfriend today. Next time, it will be C-- ---or more likely, R--. Maybe A-- is back in town. I saw M--'s face floating in the crowd of a street festival. I haven't seen her in years, but the memory of her returned to me instantly. The city's mysteries conspire with memory and confirm the purposiveness of life.

Even after all this time, when I saw M--'s face floating in the crowd I felt like I could love her. Is it just because I formed an attachment when still naivety? She has a connection to the earth, I have a watery depth. *We are both graves to each other*.

*Later, in front of La Rama around 2am*---What exactly is the idea with all this stupid writing? There's nothing else to do...The taste of tequila is still on my lips, stronger than this nice beer I have.

One thing: I learned the girl from l'E's name. *L--*. That never would have happened if D-- hadn't been there. If not for her---well, we know I would not have been able to ask. But I did have the opportunity to learn, and learn I did: her boyfriend is a 40-year-old rockstar.

Describe her: L--, bartender and "technical director" at l'E. Loose cuff on synthetic black pants; cheap, beat up running shoes. Smiling and friendly in a plain and homely kind of way, but evidently habituated to the big city life. The most classically feminine element of her appearance is the hair. Long, wavy, down past the shoulders, tips holding on to the remainder of a blonde dye job.

## Tuesday {.chapter-subsection}

Sometimes I am so drawn into the pleasure of my sensing-body that I lapse into idyll, and it's then that Life needs to remind me of my own facticity. The scorching ray of an all-seeing eye falls on me, and I am brought crashing back down into a paper body. Who I have been anchors me, a Protestant fetter that privileges me to be who I am now.

We might feel differently about the organism our *cogito* is attached to, but no-one likes to be interpellated. In the course of a life, each of us will sew an idol representing ourselves; and if we fail to repay our debts, it is the duty of our creditor to stick pins through the stuffing of our joints and send bolts of blue light searing out of the interface, glimpsed in the half-light of a bored moment at the bar. Sometimes I lapse into idyll, and therefore need to be reminded of my own facticity. A facade of sociality that slips beneath the waves of forgetting, laying bare an iron edifice of fiduciary obligation. 

There's no more rude awakening than this economic trail. I tried to set fire to my icon as though it were a Wicker Man, but the rain put it out. My debts haunt me like a spectre that phases into the corporeal when I need to be disciplined, before disappearing back into the alien unknown. A creature of the imagination hovering on the edge of my peripheral, tinting my vision black when the pain overcomes me out of nowhere. *Don't make me do it. I don't like it any more than you do.* The trace of the way we lived in the world; who we are, best understood as *who we are no longer*. A tether to the past, an unjust fetter, but---let's be honest: have we really changed? Aren't we still the same desperate phylum scrabbling for survival, borrowing money without a plan for how to pay it back from someone whose memory splits the dioptre? 

Remember? Remember? She's still there, out of sight but adjacent, still in the same world as you.

*hello*

title: Moving Back and Forth
---

## Wednesday {.chapter-subsection}

There's no mistaking that going into work feels like shit. I have precious few minutes left. It doesn't feel like death, or suspended animation, but rather like stepping into an alternate reality. I'm not good at moving back and forth, especially when I have low commitment. Maybe that's what valuable in this job: I can be who I want to be; or, who I am: *non-committal*. But that's not who I am! I want to be outgoing, friendly, hilarious...it's just hard when you're always alone.

title: An Impossibly Remote Possibility
---

## Sunday {.chapter-subsection}

Felt terrible on Friday night when I learned that F-- made out with the buxom blonde. Felt like such a thing was an absolute impossibility for me. Felt like no such thing could ever happen to me. And he has a girlfriend. And his girlfriend is also his landlord.

Then I woke up too early, went to work tired, barely tried. Minimal effort because nothing matters, I don't do fuck all.

I had a dream that my bike was stolen.

People staring at me like I'm some kind of freak just because I'm sitting here on St-Laurent with my shirt open. They can tell that each one of the sentences I write is just more meaningless bullshit.

*"He sat in the sun on the concrete steps in front of the hairdresser's, writing in his book before work, shirt open and chest bared to the world."*

*"On pavement steps in front of the *coifferie*, sun on belly-skin, pen on book-skin, counting down the minutes before work, heart open to an alarmed world."*

title: First Memory of Forming Words
---

## Saturday {.chapter-subsection}

Idea for a portfolio piece: a short work, almost like a chant, all rhythm, mostly questions. Give it some form, but its function is to list everything I know, everything I've ever wanted to learn, everything I've ever asked myself. Give it a kind of chronology, make it also a story of coming-of-age. The questions compound. Start with writing Jack and the Bean-stalk in kindergarten (first memory of forming words); then copying out *Narnia*; then writing stories and poems to express my sex- and power-fantasies. The poem I wrote about 9/11: *The Usurpers*. Then the unleashing of imagination, in the form of both writing and reading. Musical father, visual mother. Both proletariat. Became a philosopher all on my own. Make the reader feel how it feels to be on the outside. There can also be dialogue, the ultimate signifier of narrative writing.

title: Insufficient Funds II
---

## Wednesday {.chapter-subsection}

The second (?) time this year I had a transaction declined for insufficient funds. I like that it's a "coffee bar" here [PR]. Has the same set-up as a bar, although I will say that this shade of green is not a pastel....

What else? There's something---to work on...SSHRC, school applications...the first ones are in December. And we also need to work on the APCON essay. Need to start that this week. What do we have? THANKSGIVING, and therefore Indigenous--Settler relations; but also---cosmologies? Truth and reconciliation? That's related to ideas of power, which is another element of the CFP.

There are too many hot chicks here, with too much skin showing. It's hot out today. Mini-heat wave. I overdressed. This is not even to mention the nipples through cheap tank tops.

title: The Rain Theory
---

## Friday {.chapter-subsection}

What are we going to research for the APCON piece?

- Epicurus is the rain guy
- Who's the Eternal Return guy? We studied this in Falcone's class. I can't immediately recall because I'm a sub-par student. In a way, it's like learning math: useful to exercise the brain, more efficient if you can do the operation internally, but ultimately obsolete thanks to the technology of the calculator / the Stanford encyclopedia.
- Who are we going to cite for the indigenous cosmologies? Leanne Simpson? What do these cosmologies even consist of?

The third is supposed to relate to process philosophy. It's a vision of life as inter-connected movement.

*The encounter with M-- happens here.*

title: What's Happening With M--
---

What's happening with M--? I felt bad right away, and now I'm worried. My reflex is to fear that she's going to fall in love. Even as I am absolutely sick with self-loathing, I also know my power level.

I keep getting picked up---picked up off the street like a piece of trash---; I am "husband material," as F-- put it. I'm easy---"the town bicycle," as A-- once put it. What does it mean for me to say *no* to someone? It feels impossible. I'm too afraid to hurt their feelings. Too afraid to face another long stretch without touch, attention.

Sitting here. What would current and former friend C-- or A-- do? The latter is not a role model; the former is like a different species to me.

Woman need to learn how to decline offers of sex at some ungodly age. It's pressed on them---a threat. Whereas for me, for men, it's an offer---something I want and which feels scarce.

If I were responsible, I would not have engaged with her to begin with, but she was really fun and I'm hard up. I'm not good at pursuing women I have an actual interest in.

Now I will tell her how much I liked her flirting, her attention, and that we are not right for each other and we will not know each other again...

title: Windows Closed, Dust Inside
---

Put off seeing M--. Woke up around 10 with a heavily congested nose. Windows closed, dust inside. Dozed for another hour....then went to the cafe on Mont-Royal and Clark. One coffee not enough. Beauty everywhere. Fuck it.

For the University of Western Ontario, I'm supposed to submit two academic essays. The first can be my final for the hauntology class, [on the uncanny and phantasmagoria](/the-truth-is-haunted). It needs to be revised, which will feel good because it's profound (for me). I've put a lot of work into it, so it must be good-ish. I know I can make it much better. The challenge will be to integrate more Hegel, but I'm not sure if I can do that in a way appropriate to an academic context. The best strategy for now is to keep him in the background. It's not an essay on Hegel, after all.

[The above entry was written at R between 14h--15h. I was scheduled for 14h, but there was not enough work so I sat around for an hour before I walked out and did not return.]

title: "*Action de Grâce*"
---

Slept on the couch because too depressed to go to bed. Only left the house late. How am I going to find a new job? Don't have what it takes to go out looking. I don't have what it takes to go on. *You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on.* I deserve something better: I deserve a job that doesn't make me want to kill myself. Nothing has gotten better. My opportunities have only diminished.

All alone on the *action de grâce*. What should I be thankful for?

- Fit, strong, muscular, as I worked hard to achieve
- Face is fine
- Apartment
- Good cat, healthy and sweet
- Hair
- Tall end of average height
- Friends who are nice to me, and with whom I mostly like to spend time. They'll be gone now that I no longer work there.

Ile Flotante, Fleurs & Cadeaux, Boxermans, Le plongeoir, Pichai.

*At the gym*---Sometimes an old crush passes in front of the mirror---behind you but invisible like a spectre.

I thought the fact that my bandanna and her hair were both red was enough of a sign. It wasn't.

title: What my Voice Reveals
---

When I gave my order to the Olimpi-bro, I could feel the girl in front of me's surprise. My voice reveals something that my visage doesn't. Inwardness, infinite inwardness.

- Roseline: 17h
- Buvette chez Simone: 16h
- Taverne Atlantic: 16h
- Pichai: 17h
- Harricana: 12h
- Fleurs & Cadeaux: 17h
- Ile flottante: 17h

*Later, at Bishop*---These diary entries are something, but I will often just skip over a description of the most important events of my life. I need more description of the world outside myself.

Right now I am sitting at Bishop \& Bagg, 1.5 pints deep. I've just finished sending emails to V-- and C--. The first, an apology, as well as an attempt at eroticism. Asked what she likes; tried to get explicit, to use a few of the magic words.

Pulled into a sickening loop with Palestine news. Pulled into posting in a manner that is unbecoming because of how pointless it is.

What should I be working on? The writing prompt for this week is "beyond critique."

- Thanksgiving Essay
- *Morning Regrets*
- Beneath Language
- MA applications
