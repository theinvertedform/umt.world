The white cowboy hat should be enough for you to recognize me because there aren't too many people wearing white cowboy hats. Salt and pepper. After we make contact, but any eye contact should be minimal and insincere, I'll excuse myself and from that point on I'll assume our next contact will be the drop. I'll have it in my hand, and you have the money. When you walk by, touch me on my right elbow and I'll know it's you. Your young hand will rarely have touched something so calloused as my own.
