I have been dreaming of that square kilometre so frequently, and with such vivid perspective, that I have begun to lose track of which image was unconsciously invented, and which comes from the city's Appearance. Zarathustra screams relentlessly in my ear: *You must overcome! What if a demon came to you in the night?!* Well, I'm tired, old man. The force of Understanding never lets up; and in my tiredness, I can't help but lapse into nostalgic recollection. My mind wanders back to those days of stupefaction, distant enough that they may as well be a dream. That square kilometre is squatted with ruined buildings, and at the base of each is a broken plaque that reads: *My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!* 

Quarantined to North, South, East, and West, that square kilometre has an obsolete purpose that has been struck from the memory of our Contemporary. No-one visits here during the day except those members of an esoteric parallel society of Book Worshippers. Inscribed in their pre-historic Alphabet, the first commandment reads: *Never change!* While God rests, those possessed by the spirit of adventurous Youth dare to essay into this Kilometre with their bands of closest accomplices. Here, an entire generation of the City chipped their plows vainly scraping furrows in the unforgiving piss- and paint-stained concrete. If we had been blessed by the Book and brought into parallel flight from the Modern World, we might have learned not to put all our hope in the *crop rotation method*. Instead, we could have planted our seed in more verdant turf. Is it the Harvest Moon that lights this Page for you, Reader, or a moon tinted orange by fires out West? Me and my kind, you reading this, you know who you are: we reap our crop of chrysanthemums and radishes, but they are not enough to sustain us as summer turns to fall. Pebbles of asphalt dig into the palm of my hand as I lean back sitting in concrete alleyways that still hold the heat of the sun. An intense crowd of buzzing kids, drinking and smoking outside behind the underground cabaret. This was once the centre of my entire world. When I revisit those memories in my dreams with such vivid perspective, I see the shadow of a horned Beast looming over us in the night. More and more I chase that feeling that erupted out of nothing; more and more I chase the addiction of my own na√Øvety and following the first commandment---to repeat myself: *Never change!*. I see the shadow chasing me through heat waves in the night. Had we found a way to break through that concrete to the soil below, could we really have grown enough to sustain an entire village?
