But that square kilometre, I say, I have dreamed of so frequently and with such vivid perspective, that I am no longer certain which of these images come from my own process of cognition, and which were given to me by the city's Appearance. Now in my maturity I pay the toll for those days of dreaming. That square kilometre, cordoned-off by train tracks to north, south, and west, squatted upon by low, ramshackle buildings that no-one visited except under cover of night with their band of closest accomplices, broke the plows of endless youths. Instead of vainly attempting to scrape our furrows in the unforgiving piss- and paint-stained concrete, ought we instead to have rotated our crops in a more forgiving terrain? Here as I collect my harvest of white roses and chrysanthemums, I long for fertile soil capable of hosting something more nourishing than a *memento mori*. I still feel the pebbles of asphalt on my hand, as I lean back on still-hot concrete fields. More and more as I chase that feeling that erupted out of nothing, more and more as I chase the addiction of my own na√Øvety, I can see the Demon who looms up out of the haze of heat waves in the night. Had we found a way to break through that concrete to the soil below, might we then have been successful in finding a way to nourish ourselves?
