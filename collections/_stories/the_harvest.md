But that square kilometre, I say, I have been dreaming of so frequently and with such vivid perspective that I am no longer certain which of these images was invented in memory, and which was given by the city's Appearance. Zarathustra's senility was not well-represented in his book; now, in-between smearing excrement on the walls of his mountain sanatorium, he screams relentlessly *You must overcome! What if a demon came to you in the night?!* In fatigue, my mind wanders back to days of innocent, now so distant they may as well themselves be a dream. That square kilometre, I say, is squatted with ruined buildings at the base of which is a pedestal: *My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!* Quarantined to North, South, East and West, that square kilometre carries forth a lingering purpose obsolete and struck from the invented memory of the Contemporary. No-one visits here during the day except members of an esoteric parallel society of Book Worshippers. Inscribed in their pre-historic Alphabet, its first commandment reads: *Never change!* Under cover of night, those possessed by the spirit of adventurous Youth dare to venture into this Kilometre only with the security of a band of closest accomplices. Here, an entire generation of the City chipped our plows vainly attempting to scrape furrows in the unforgiving piss- and paint-stained concrete. If we had the fortune to be blessed by the Book and brought into parallel flight from the Modern World, we would have learned not to rely on the *crop rotation method*. Instead, we might have had the opportunity to plant our seed in more hospitable turf. Is it the Harvest Moon that lights this Page, or a moon tinted orange by fires out West? Me and my ilk reap our harvest of chrysanthemums and radishes, but we will starve in the coming winter. Pebbles of asphalt dig into the palm of my hand as I lean back on concrete fields holding on to the heat of the sun. An intense crowd of buzzing kids, drinking and smoking in between sets outside in the alley of the underground venue. This was once the centre of my youth. When I revisit these memories in my dreams with vivid perspective I see the Beast that hovers over us all. More and more as I chase that feeling that erupted out of nothing, more and more as I chase the addiction of my own na√Øvety, I can see the Demon who looms up out of the haze of heat waves in the night. Had we found a way to break through that concrete to the soil below, might we then have been successful in finding a way to nourish ourselves?
