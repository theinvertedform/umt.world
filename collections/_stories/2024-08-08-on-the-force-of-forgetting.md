I have been dreaming of that square kilometre so frequently, and with such vivid perspective, that I have lost track of which image comes from within and which was given to me by the city's Appearance. I remember walking down a broken alley and into a massive, ruined industrial building. There I wandered wide, wood-planked corridors until finding my way into some cavernous loft. The detritus of industry gave access to something foreclosed to we who who were born after the End of History. An exposed pipe became a signifier of Authenticity, even if no-one was paying for heating. The sun sets through poorly-insulated windows. Wood and white t-shirts glow in the golden hour. I hope you remember something similar. The sense of taking part in a secret gathering, hidden inside the ruins of History. Forgetting is an active power: I must have chosen to blur the origin of this memory, to destabilize its veracity and thereby turn memory into myth. But I don’t remember. What better souvenir than a simulacrum for we Contemporaries, living on the unfulfilled cusp?

The force of Understanding never lets up; and in my old age, yes, I have been known to indulge in *nostalgic reverie*. That square kilometre is still squatted with ruins, even as the Enemy gains ground and replaces them with condos. Plasticky monuments to an age without memory. At the base of each ruin is a plaque tarnished by the passage of unknown time. It reads: *My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!* Once I laughed at the vain King whose kitschy monuments had already long-since eroded when the Poet came across them. Now, in my old age, I have attained the wisdom of the King who undertakes to memorialize against the erosion of time.

Once that square kilometre had a purpose. Quarantined by railroads to North, South, and West, it survived as an oasis preserved outside of time. Now it’s just some geographical puzzle for Capital to solve. An obelisk engraved with cuneiform and stuck next to Café Dispatch, or some other weightless product of the ultra-modern. Two ages clashing incongruously, and we know that the Present will predictably prefer the non-committal. The Contemporary abhors mass, in architecture and in life; it is deathly afraid to show commitment, for it knows rightly that any Pharaonic pretender will be forgotten before their monument has even finished construction. No-one visits this square kilometre during the day except those members of an esoteric parallel society of Book Worshippers. Inscribed in a pre-historic Alphabet, their first commandment reads: *Never change!*

In that square kilometre, an entire generation of the City vainly sought to bring History back to life by piecing together what it could remember. We could not achieve the weightiness we remembered, and now we are left to harvest our crop of chrysanthemums and radishes. They push up through the broken alley. Pebbles dig into the palm of my hand as I lean back, one night in that square kilometre. A crowd buzzes and smokes, white t-shirts glowing under halogen street lights. This was once the centre of my universe.[^1] The ceaseless crest of the Contemporary has trapped us at the moment of disintegration. Lines of flight Appear to point in every direction, but they are all controlled by the enemy and bring us back to the same point: the ever-disintegrating, eternally-cresting, never-breaking, onrushing *Now*. We would be better off writing all our wisdom down in a Book, retreating from society, and laboriously teaching the next generations to live outside of time. Recollection has mass and is therefore weighed down by the Spirit of Gravity, while the force of forgetting flies weightlessly through cloudless skies. I chase that vivid perspective of my dream until the image of reality and Appearance blur together, and I live by that first commandment: *Never change!*
