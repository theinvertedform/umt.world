# At the *péage*

*On the run* --- *The oppressive forest* --- *Barcelona attacks*

The highway broadened out into ten wide lanes of concrete reflecting the heat of the August sun. The droning forest that crowded in on the asphalt expanse competed with the constant rasping drone of diesel motors. He struck an incongruous figure at this otherworldly place, car-less at a remote way-station, an oasis of bureaucracy in the middle of a forest. He stood on the shoulder of the highway, near the booth where a black man was crammed, sat in a reflective vest, glancing curiously in his direction between taking money and giving change. He stuck out his arm. A trucker, already pulling into the right-side lane reserved for large vehicles, beckoned to him through the window. There was a ladder built into the side of the vehicle, and as he stepped into the cab, the driver addressed him excitedly.

"*Il y avait une attaque en Barcelone*," he said. The driver was a Frenchman, lean and composed in his equally well-maintained vehicle.

"An attack?"

"Yes, a terrorist attack. They were driving vehicles through crowds in *La Rambla*. It just happened a few hours ago."

The man was excited by the news. He was brimming over with energy describing it.
