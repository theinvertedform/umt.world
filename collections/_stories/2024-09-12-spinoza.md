The highway broadened to a dozen lanes as it approached the *péage*. A river of concrete magnifying the August sun, forest droning on all sides. Nigel stood in the shimmering heat with his backpack over one shoulder. At the end of each lane was a gate and a tiny tollbooth, and crammed into each was a man wearing a yellow vest. One of them looked over at him, eyes standing out white in his face.

Encrusted in road grime, Nigel looked backwards as he made his way to a better position. He stuck out his arm. A sixteen-wheeler pulled to the right; its driver beckoned from behind the windshield. There was a ladder built into the vehicle's side, and as Nigel climbed into the cab, the trucker immediately said, "*Il y avait une attaque à Barcelone*." 

He leaned forward over the wheel, t-shirt hanging loose from his lean torso. Veins stood out in his arms. His hair was close-cut and his cheeks shaved. 

"Someone hijacked a van and drove it through *La Rambla*." The trucker showed a paper to the man in the booth, who peered at Nigel as he waved them through.

They shifted into gear and accelerated out of the *péage*. "You can put your bag in the back." A curtain separated the cab from a neat little bunk, complete with a reading light and nightstand.

"Who was it?"

"Some Islamic terrorist. He's still on the run, but he won't get far." The air blowing from the vents chilled his sweat-damp shirt. His unwashed body and clothes were disguised by the perfectly neutral odour of the HEPA filter. The hot cabs of the other trucks Nigel had ridden in throughout Eastern Europe smelled like mingled grease and locker rooms. The truckers were all equally mad, but France, in all its vanity, trains its citizens to maintain appearances in the name of the motherland. Outside the centre of Europe, truth still has meaning and image corresponds to the interior. The trucker's wiry body radiated an unhealthy electric aura. On long-haul journeys, he used a hand-held vacuum to clean the floor, the upholstery of the bench; he wiped down the console and checked the air filter. Then he would take one of the methamphetamine tablets sold at the Monoprix and prescribed by the company doctor, and drive unblinking through the night.

The trucker fixed Nigel with a stare. "They hate our freedom. Spain has a new party called Podemos. They're just a few years old, and very popular. They're one of the most far-left political parties in Europe. I thought they were going too far. Turns out I'm not the only one."

They listened to news over the radio, but Nigel could not follow the presenter's French. The trucker left him outside a small village as dusk turned to gloaming. Nigel spread his groundsheet under a bridge, laid down and traced the lines of its rusty iron girders, the cracks in the concrete embankment. Where were all those Roman aqueducts and Gothic cathedrals? This was no different from the nights spent under bridges back in the New World.

The sun woke him at dawn and he went to sit in the village square. Half an hour passed without any movement. A bakerwoman approached.

"*Bon matin, monsieur*," she said. "More than food, it looks like a gesture of human kindness is what you need. Take this." She handed him a *jambon-beurre* with a brave smile, eyes concerned. He waited until she had rejoined the group in front of the cafe before he removed the ham. The baguette was soft and perfectly chewy, spread with salty butter and rich, mild brie. It was not yet seven o'clock, but the group in front of the cafe were happy to rise early and discuss the headlines, commenting on the changing tides in European politics. A blue arrow on a white field pointed the way to the beach, where he found the public showers he expected. He didn't know the name of this village or where he found himself, other than the south of France; couldn't remember which direction he had come from or where he was going when the trucker picked him up. 

He found his way to the road and stuck out his arm, glancing back over his shoulder.

By the time the sun had passed its zenith, Nigel had travelled hundreds of kilometres, but his situation remained unchanged. Instead of the claustrophobic heat and din of the *péage*, now it was the silence of rolling hills that weighed on him. Parched grass glowed golden in the afternoon sun. A ruined barn stood nearby, blackened beams casting shadows that crept closer. An hour passed with no traffic. The quiet became more and more oppressive. *I didn't do anything wrong. It's not my fault.*

He saw the car coming before he heard it. Saw it descend one hill, disappear on the ascent, then re-appear, diesel engine buzzing toyfully. It stopped in front of him without bothering to pull over.

"You're a long way from nowhere," the man said.

"And this oppressive quiet leaves me with nothing to do but think."

The man turned his head to see who had entered his car. He wore round, wire-rimmed glasses; like the trucker, his cheeks were shaved and his hair kept short. He did not engage the clutch. "What's so difficult about thinking?"

"Gravity weighs me down, and I end up circling back to the past." Nigel disregarded the car's lack of movement. 

"Thought is what makes our existence unique. Running from thought is like running from what it means to be alive."

"Jesus said, 'Physician, heal thyself'---but I think I was put on this earth to suffer."

The man seemed satisfied that Nigel was simply depressed, and not violent. He put the car in gear and they continued down the next hill.

"I spent my whole life in Paris until a couple years ago. Bought a vineyard with some friends and moved out of the city. It took me time to learn to enjoy the quiet. It helps that farm life is always busy. If there's time to sit, you're too tired to think. How about you? You speak French, but with an accent. You must be Canadian."

"I live in Montréal, but gravity was weighing too heavily on me. I needed another perspective. It's not the first time I've gone on the road, but I fear that this will be the last time. In a few months, I will enter the institution and begin working towards a degree in philosophy."

"Philosophy was never my speciality, but all students in France read some philosophy in high school. Plato, Descartes, Kant, just the basics." The man brought his left knee up and wedged his foot under his right thigh. "Spinoza was the one I really fell in love with. His *Ethics* turned me into an environmentalist, and he was writing centuries before the concept even existed. I tried to organize our farm based on his concepts. It's a biodynamic system: everything contributes something, and there's very little waste. What's your name?"

"Call me Nigel. It's the name I gave myself. Just like Spinoza."

The man turned his head to look at Nigel again, lips pursed. "Baruch became Benedictus after he was banished from his community. What are you running from, Nigel?"

Some distance later, they pulled over at a crossroad and both exited the car. The man took a bottle of wine from a box in the trunk.

"Here, take this. A bottle from the vineyard. God will get you where you need to be, my friend."

"Listen to this," she said. "It's an interview with one of the leaders of Podemos, that socialist party that just got elected in Spain. 'Podemos is a hypothesis. It is possible to build upon the new political space opening in front of us. This is a matter of experiencing society as it is changing in front of you---watching Spanish society change after the *Indignados* movement, developing new ways of framing politics, of feeling politics, even of hating politics...'"

They were lying under her red duvet, mattress on the dark hardwood floor. A lamp and its bare filament bulb cast a warm orange glow in the windowless room. A snowstorm beat against the bricks, but they couldn't hear it over the cat, purring like an engine. She kept reading---her lips would not stop moving. She breathed in and out, chest rising and falling beneath her thin night-shirt. Nigel tried not to let this distract him, focusing on all the keywords he recognized. A blue flame sparked in his diaphragm, heating up his brain and sending a hand out to touch her---but at the same moment, a shadow of doubt fell over him, chilling his heat and stopping the movement before it even began.

"'There is now a cooperation and a solidarity that didn't exist before these movements... All this is an inspiration much greater than Marx or Spinoza, though there are people in Podemos with an academic background, like myself. I come from the Critical Theory tradition---from Adorno. Actually my Ph.D. was on Walter Benjamin, so I come from the Critical Theory, Marxist, academic left world. But I have learned a lot... in terms of how social movements and solidarity networks have developed. And my understanding of politics has changed.'" [^1]

She turned her head to make eye contact. "Weren't you reading a book by Spinoza?" Her face was impassive.

"His book on ethics. It was written in Latin, which was uncommon for the 17th century, and modelled after math textbooks. The religious authority of his day thought he was too much of a pantheist, and they ended up excommunicating him from the Jewish community in Amsterdam, where he lived. He had a huge influence, but published little and spent his life working as a lens grinder, dying young from inhaling glass dust." Everything he knew was biographical, historical: he could say nothing of substance about the actual content of his philosophy.

"In Europe, our institutions are historically-oriented." She spoke English with a Chicago accent, which always made him forget that she was a French citizen. "Mass political movements have leaders with PhDs in critical theory. Academics are activists, and vice-versa. In America, you will never catch a politician making historical references."

"The point of that quote is that activism leads to a new understanding of philosophy. Just like Marx and Lenin have always said."

"Well you should do more activism. It's not like you're in school, and you barely work." The flame in his diaphragm turned green. Something was burning, letting off toxic smoke.

"I never said I was an activist. You're the one in journalism school."

She turned back to her newspaper. It needed to be unfolded to a square the size of a blanket between articles. As she was re-folding it into a new configuration, he caught sight of the title page: *The Platypus Review*, number 72. 'The left is dead.'

The shadow spread from his brain and wrapped around his neck. There was no warmth under their red blanket. The cat's eyes went wide, its ears stood up and the purring stopped. In the sudden silence, he could hear the storm raging on the other side of the wall. His blood froze in his veins.

In the grass by the roundabout, Nigel watched the cars drive in circles, diesel engines boring into his ears, and turned the bottle of wine in his hand. He needed to find a corkscrew before he could open it. All roads in France lead to Paris, and every village has a miniature version of the *Périphérique*, the immense roundabout that circles the capital of the 19th century. He had come to Europe because he had read about Goethe's *grand tour*, and wanted to undertake his own rite of passage. He couldn't afford to visit which of those 18th century landmarks still existed, so he visited one of the few locations he knew about. 

The École Normale Supérieur, on the rue d'Ulm, top school in the country's Enlightenment-based education system. Once attended by the likes of Sartre, Althusser, Foucault, Derrida, and so many of the intellectual stars Nigel spent his hours with book in hand arranging into constellations, instead of reading. He arrived at the beginning of summer, during the off-season. The tall iron gates stood locked, no activity to be discerned behind the building's arched windows.

The bookstore at the corner had its lights switched off until the students returned. The complete Galimard editions of Spinoza's works occupied the majority of the window display, arranged alongside a selection of secondary literature authored by *normaliens*: *Expressionism in Philosophy*, *Hegel or Spinoza*, *Spinoza for Our Time*...

Next to the bookstore was a *brasserie* with its lights on. It didn't occur to him to enter. Students from the school must come here after lectures, buzzing with the possibility of thought. What celestial machinations would it take for him to find his way to the ÉNS, one of the highest peaks of institutional thought? Even if he had grown up in Paris, he could never have found his way to the top. He would end up moving to the country with some friends to start a biodynamic vineyard. The same doom lay before him as it lies before everyone: to have started too late. He read Spinoza without understanding. The words were a brick wall concealing a meaning that he could never reach.

It glimmered in the corner of his eye: the repetition of Spinoza constituted a sign, he decided. Twice is a coincidence, but three times is a summons. Nigel lifted his chin and looked in the direction he thought was north. He would go and visit Spinoza. He had no idea where his grave lay---had never thought about visiting a grave, much less that of Spinoza. The philosopher did not figure prominently in his internal constellation. He could guess that he must lie interred somewhere in the Netherlands. He had time enough to learn.

It ended up taking only three days to get there. First, without intending it, he got a ride into Paris and spent a sleepless night on a bench in the 13th *arrondissement*. In the morning, he spent seven hours on the side of the Périphique trying to catch a ride. It didn't work; exhausted, he paid for a bus ticket to the closest destination outside of the city. Five hours later, in the early evening, he was deposited in the centre of Luxembourg. He boarded the midnight train for The Hague without a ticket. A hand shook him awake. Instinctively, he tried to pretend like he was still asleep. A pointless effort, as the hand only shook him more roughly.

"*Billet, monsieur.*" The man's heavy face was pulled downward from years of shaking awake vagrants. His gold-tasseled uniform looked like an historical artifact from the 19th century.

Nigel, still operating on road-instinct, did his best to appear groggy even though his senses were alert. This did nothing to help him, however, when he had no ticket to present. The man produced a pad of paper, wrote him a ticket of infraction for 60 euro, and left him alone.

"You can keep the duvet," she said.

"Why would I keep the duvet? It's yours."

She thought about it for a moment.

"You're right, never-mind. I'll take it with me and you can just fuck off."

She folded up the big red blanket. The sun was coming through his bedroom window. The most recent issue of *The Platypus Review* sat on his desk: issue 96, May 2017. It was his room, his desk, but she had been living there for months. That was over: it was all over.
