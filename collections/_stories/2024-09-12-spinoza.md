The highway broadened out into a dozen lanes as it approached the *péage*. A river of concrete magnifying the August sun, forest droning in on all sides. Nigel stood in the shimmering heat with his backpack, encrusted in road grime. He looked back over his shoulder as he made his way to a better position. One of the men wearing a yellow vest and crammed into the tiny tollbooths at the end of each lane looked at him. Nigel stuck out his arm. A sixteen-wheeler was pulling to the right; its driver beckoned to him from behind the windshield. There was a ladder built into the vehicle's side, and as Nigel climbed up and into the cab, the man began talking right away, excited.

"*Il y avait une attaque en Barcelone*." The driver leaned forward over the wheel, t-shirt hanging loose from his lean torso. Veins stood out in his muscular arms. The cab was clean and tidy, unlike the stinking, filthy cells of the Polish and Turkish trucks Nigel had ridden in. The Frenchman was just as mad as those other men, eagerly relating the story of a hijacked vehicle cleaving through thick crowds of pedestrians on La Rambla. Madness appeared on the surface of those Easterners, whereas the Frenchman swept the floor, wiped down his console, and stared unblinking at the road ahead.

"Who hijacked the truck?"

"An Islamic terrorist, of course." The driver looked at him as though he were stupid. "They hate our freedom. Spain just elected one of the most socialist parties in Europe. I thought they were going too far. Turns out I'm not the only one."

The trucker left him outside a small village as dusk turned into gloaming. Nigel spread his groundsheet on the cobblestones under the village bridge, laid down and looked up at its rusty iron girders, the concrete embankment. Where were all those ancient things? This looked no different from the undersides of all the bridges he had slept under back in the New World. 

When the morning light woke him, he went to sit in the village square. A bakerwoman handed him a *jambon-beurre* with a pitying smile. He waited until she was gone before picking off the ham, then followed the signs to the beach. There, he found the public showers he had expected. The water was cold, leaving him full of vigorous energy that dissipated aimlessly. He didn't know where he was other than the south of France: didn't know what this village was called, couldn't remember which direction he had come from or where he had been headed when the trucker picked him up. He found his way to the road and stuck his arm out, looking back over his shoulder.

By the time the sun had begun its slow descent, he had wound up in the middle of nowhere again. Instead of the claustrophobic heat and din of the *péage*, now it was the silence of rolling hills that weighed down on him. Parched grass glowed golden in the afternoon light. A ruined barn stood nearby, blackened beams casting shadows that crept steadily closer. An hour passed with no traffic. The calm became more and more oppressive. *I didn't do anything wrong. It's not my fault.*

He saw the car coming before he heard it. Saw it descend one hill, disappear on the ascent, then re-appear, diesel engine buzzing toyfully. It stopped in front of him without bothering to pull over.

"*Vous êtes loin de nulle part*," the man said.

"I thought quiet is what I needed, but all it does is make me start to worry."

"I wouldn't know," the man said, turning his head to make eye contact. "I was born and raised in Paris and always longed for the countryside. A few years ago, some partners and I bought a vineyard and moved on to the land. I get to enjoy the quiet of country life, but it's busy! There's always something to do, there's never time to think. How about you? You speak French, but you have an English accent, so you must be Canadian."

"That's right, I live in Montréal. I'm a philosophy student. This is month three of my four-month vacation."

"Oh, philosophy! My degree was in environmental studies, but I studied some philosophy, too. Do you know Spinoza?"

"Yes, I've read him."

"He was important to me because he's an environmental philosopher, centuries before environmentalism was a concept. His *Ethics* is what motivated me to organize our farm the way we do. It's a biodynamic system: everything contributes something to everything. The chickens control the pests, the pigs maintain the compost. There's very little waste. What's your name?"

"Nigel. Like Spinoza, I came up with a new name."

"Baruch became Benedictus after he was banished from his community." The man turned his head to look at Nigel again.

Before continuing onto his farm, the man pulled over at a crossroad and got out of the car with Nigel. He took a bottle of wine from the trunk of his car.

"Here, take this. A bottle from the vineyard. God will get you where you need to be, Nigel."

"Listen to this," she said. "It's an interview with one of the leaders of Podemos, the socialist party that just got elected in Spain. 'Podemos is a hypothesis. It is possible to build upon the new political space opening in front of us. This is a matter of experiencing society as it is changing in front of you---watching Spanish society change after the *Indignados* movement, developing new ways of framing politics, of feeling politics, even of hating politics...'"

They were lying under her red duvet, mattress on the dark hardwood floor. A lamp and its bare filament bulb cast a warm orange glow in the windowless room. Head cocked, he carefully noted all the keywords he could. She kept reading---her lips would not stop moving. She breathed in and out, chest rising and falling beneath her thin night-shirt. A blue flame sparked in his brain and sent his hand toward her; at the same moment, a shadow fell over him, halting the movement before it even began.

"'These are all things that we have experienced. There is now a cooperation and a solidarity that didn't exist before these movements, which hadn't existed for years. All this is an inspiration much greater than Marx or Spinoza, though there are people in Podemos with an academic background, like myself. I come from the Critical Theory tradition---from Adorno. Actually my Ph.D. was on Walter Benjamin, so I come from the Critical Theory, Marxist, academic left world. But I have learned a lot from the experience of the last few years, in terms of how social movements and solidarity networks have developed. And my understanding of politics has changed.'[^1]

"Weren't you reading a book by Spinoza?" She turned her head to make eye contact. Her face was still.

"That's his book on ethics. It's written like a math textbook. He was excommunicated for being too critical of biblical authority, and especially for being too much of a Pantheist. He published very little and ended up dying from inhaling glass dust. That guy's point is that political activism led him to a new understanding of philosophy. The same thing Marx and Lenin have always said."

"So why don't you do more activism, rather than just reading all day? Don't you think you would have a better understanding of the world if you were out in it?" She turned away again, back to her newspaper. The shadow spread from his brain, down through his neck, turning his blood to ice.

Once more in a village whose name he didn't know, Nigel considered opening the bottle. He would need to find a corkscrew first. Sitting in the grass next to a roundabout, watching the cars drive around in circles, his mind went back to his arrival in Paris three months ago. He didn't know what he was doing---had really only come to Europe because he had read about Goethe's *grand tour*, and therefore understood it to be a rite of passage---and so he visited one of the few locations he knew about. The École Normale Supérieur (ÉNS), on the rue d'Ulm, the top school in the country's deeply hierarchical education system, attended by the likes of Sartre, Althusser, Foucault, Derrida, and many others from the most famous French intellectuals who had defined critical theory in the second half of the century. Nigel was there during the off-season. The tall iron gates were locked, and there was no activity to be discerned behind the nondescript building's arched windows.

The bookstore at the corner was also closed. On prominent display in the window were the complete Galimard editions of his works, as well as several works of secondary literature: *Expressionism in Philosophy*, *Hegel où Spinoza*, *Spinoza for Our Time*...

Next to the bookstore was a bar. It was open, but Nigel looked on without entering. Even if he had been born in France, he could never have found his way to the country's top school. Would the prospect have motivated him to try? He read books like the *Ethics* without understanding. The words were arranged on the page like bricks in a wall. They concealed something that he could not break through. The wall was enough to confirm the presence something secret concealed behind it, even if he could never catch sight of that ancient wisdom.

*Spinoza, Spinoza, Spinoza.* Sitting there in the village square, unsure of where he was and even less sure of where he was going, the Dutchman's name echoed in his head. It was a sign. Three signs, and therefore a sign from the universe. He lifted his chin and looked in the direction he thought was north: that's where he would go. He would go and visit Spinoza. He didn't know where he was buried, but he could guess that it would be somewhere in the Netherlands. If not in Amsterdam, where the man had lived, then somewhere nearby. There would be time enough to learn.

It ended up taking only three days to get there. First, without intending it, he got a ride into Paris and spent a sleepless night on a bench in the 13th *arrondissement*. In the morning, he spent seven hours on the side of the Périphique trying to catch a ride. It didn't work; exhausted, he paid for a bus ticket to the closest destination outside of the city. Five hours later, in the early evening, he was deposited in the centre of Luxembourg. He boarded the midnight train for The Hague without a ticket. A hand shook him awake. Instinctively, he tried to pretend like he was still asleep. A pointless effort, as the hand only shook him more roughly.

"*Billet, monsieur.*" The man's heavy face was pulled downward from years of shaking awake vagrants. His gold-tasseled uniform looked like an historical artifact from the 19th century.

Nigel, still operating on road-instinct, did his best to appear groggy even though his senses were alert. This did nothing to help him, however, when he had no ticket to present. The man produced a pad of paper, wrote him a ticket of infraction for 60 euro, and left him alone.

# The Hague

*Cavernous empty ultra-modern city* --- *Ghoulish public art* --- *Buying weed* --- *The Church* --- *Drink, smoke, cry* --- Capital *is my pillow*

# Nothing was the Same

*The revolution in Spain is over* --- *No lessons are learned* --- *Hope remains*
