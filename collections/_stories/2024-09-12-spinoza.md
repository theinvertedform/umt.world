The highway broadened out into a dozen lanes as it approached the *péage*. A river of concrete magnifying the August sun, forest droning in on all sides. Nigel stood in the shimmering heat, backpack over one shoulder, encrusted in road grime. He looked back over his shoulder as he made his way to a better position. One of the men crammed into the tiny tollbooths looked at him. Nigel stuck out his arm. A sixteen-wheeler was pulling to the right; its driver beckoned to him from behind the windshield. There was a ladder built into the vehicle's side, and as Nigel climbed into the cab, the man began talking right away, excited.

"*Il y avait une attaque en Barcelone*." He leaned forward over the wheel, t-shirt hanging loose from his lean torso. Veins stood out in his muscular arms. The cab was clean and tidy, unlike the stinking, filthy cells of the Polish and Turkish trucks Nigel had ridden in. The Frenchman was just as mad as those other men, and eagerly related the story of a hijacked vehicle cleaving through the thick crowds of pedestrians on La Rambla. It was the same madness that appeared on the surface of those Easterners, whereas the Frenchman swept the floor, wiped down his console, and stared unblinking at the road ahead.

The trucker deposited him on the outskirts of a small village as the gloaming set in. There was a tarp in Nigel's pack, but the weather was good. He spread his groundsheet under the first bridge he found, laid down and looked up at its rusty iron girders, the concrete embankment, wondering if this was one of those ancient Roman bridges. In the morning light, he sat in the village square considering his next move. A bakerwoman handed him a *jambon-et-beure* with a pitying smile. He didn't have the heart to say no, so waited until she was gone before picking off the ham. He followed the signs to the beach nearby, where he found the public showers he had expected. The water was cold, leaving him full of vigorous energy that dissipated almost immediately. He didn't know where he was other than the south of France: didn't know what this village was called, couldn't remember which direction he had come from or where he had been headed when the trucker picked him up. He found his way to the road and stuck his arm out, looking over his shoulder.

By the time the sun had begun its slow summer descent, he had wound up in the middle of nowhere again. Instead of the claustrophobic heat and din of the *péage*, the silence of rolling hills weighed down on him. Parched grass glowed golden in the afternoon light. A ruined barn stood nearby, blackened beams casting shadows that crept steadily closer. An hour passed with no traffic. The calm became more and more oppressive. *I didn't do anything wrong. It's not my fault.*

He saw the car coming before he heard it. Saw it descend one hill, disappear on the ascent, then re-appear, diesel engine buzzing like a toy. It stopped in front of him without bothering to pull over.

"*Vous êtes loin de nul part*," the man said.

"After Paris, I thought it's what I needed, but the stillness just leads me to start worrying about everything that's gone wrong in my life."

"I wouldn't know," the man said, smiling and turning his head to make eye contact. "I was born and raised in Paris and always longed for the countryside. A few years ago, some partners and I bought a vineyard and moved on to the land. I get to enjoy the quiet of country life, but it's busy! There's always something to do. How about you? You speak French, but you have the accent of an Anglophone. Are you Canadian?"

"That's right, I live in Montréal. I'm a philosophy student. I'm on summer vacation. I'm on month three of a four-month vacation."

"Oh, philosophy! My degree was in environmental studies, but I studied some philosophy, too. Do you know Spinoza?"

"He's not my specialty, but I know him."

"He was important to me because he's an environmental philosopher, centuries before environmentalism existed. Reading his *Ethics* is what motivated me to organize our vineyard the way we do. It's a completely biodynamic system: everything contributes something to everything. The chickens remove pests from the vines, for example. There's almost no waste."

The ride lasted about an hour, until the man had to turn onto his farm. He pulled over at a crossroad, and got out of the car with Nigel. He took a bottle of wine from the trunk of his car and handed it over.

"Here, take this. A gift. Safe travels, friend."

"Listen to this," she said. "It's an interview with one of the leaders of Podemos, the socialist party that just got elected in Spain. 'Podemos is a hypothesis. It is possible to build upon the new political space opening in front of us. This is a matter of experiencing society as it is changing in front of you---watching Spanish society change after the *Indignados* movement, developing new ways of framing politics, of feeling politics, even of hating politics....'"

They were lying under her red duvet, mattress on the dark hardwood floor. A lamp and its bare filament bulb cast a warm orange glow in the windowless room. Head cocked, he carefully noted all the keywords he recognized. She kept reading---her lips would not stop moving. She breathed in and out, chest rising and falling beneath her thin night-shirt. A blue flame sparked and sent a hand toward her; at the same moment, a shadow fell over his brain and halted the movement before it even began.

"'These are all things that we have experienced. There is now a cooperation and a solidarity that didn't exist before these movements, which hadn't existed for years. All this is an inspiration much greater than Marx or Spinoza, though there are people in Podemos with an academic background, like myself. I come from the Critical Theory tradition---from Adorno. Actually my Ph.D. was on Walter Benjamin, so I come from the Critical Theory, Marxist, academic left world. But I have learned a lot from the experience of the last few years, in terms of how social movements and solidarity networks have developed. And my understanding of politics has changed.'[^1]

"Weren't you reading a book by Spinoza?" She shifted to better fix her eyes on him. Her face was carefully neutral.

"That's his book on ethics. It's difficult to think about how it relates to politics. I know that he was a controversial guy, he was banished from his community, did manual labour all his life and died from inhaling glass dust...but the *Ethics* is written to be like a math textbook. It's hard to imagine how that relates to socialism in Spain."

"I see..." she turned away again, back to her newspaper. The shadow spread from his brain, down through his neck to chill his heart.

The man drove off, leaving Nigel holding his bottle of wine. He was dropped again in the centre of a village whose name he didn't know. He considered opening the bottle then and there---he would need to find a corkscrew first; but as he was sitting on the grass next to a roundabout, his mind went back to Paris. He had only spent two days there before deciding to get out of the city. He didn't know where to go, what he was doing, so he visited one of the few locations he knew about: the École Normale Supérieur on the rue d'Ulm. The school attended by Sartre, de Beauvoir, Fanon, Althusser, Deleuze, Foucault, Derrida, and the rest of the famous French intellectuals who had defined critical theory in the second half of the century. He was there during the off-season: the tall iron gates were locked, and there was no activity to be discerned behind the nondescript building's windows.

There was a bookstore at the corner, also closed for the holidays. The window display was themed around Spinoza, including hardcover editions of all his major works, published by Galimard. On prominent display was the book *Hegel où Spinoza*, by Pierre Macharey, another graduate of the ÉNS.

Next to the bookstore was a bar, open and doing good business, even now in the early afternoon. Nigel looked on without entering. If he had been born in France, could he have been selected to attend the country's top school? Would he have been motivated to try? Instead, he had not bothered to graduate from high school. He read books like Spinoza's *Ethics* without feeling confident that he understood it. There was a whole world therein---a world whose presence he felt, but which he had no access to. Thousands of years of a developing discourse that he had no insight into. He was an uneducated peasant from the provinces compared to those fortunate enough to grow up where educated itself had been invented. He could never compare.

*Spinoza, Spinoza, Spinoza.* Sitting there in the village square, unsure of where he was and even less sure of where he was going, the Dutchman's name echoed in his head. It was a sign. Three signs. He lifted his chin and looked in the direction he thought could be north: that's where he would go. He would go and visit Spinoza. He didn't know where he was buried, but he could guess that it would be somewhere in the Netherlands. If not in Amsterdam, where the man had lived, then somewhere nearby. There would be time enough to learn. How long would it take to get there?

It ended up taking only three days. First, unintentionally, he got a ride into Paris. He spent seven hours on the side of the Périphique trying to hitch a ride out. It didn't work, but still riding the energy of newfound motivation, he decided to pay for a bus ticket to the closest destination outside of the city. It happened to be Luxembourg. He boarded the midnight train for The Hague without a ticket. A hand shook him. Instinctively, he tried to pretend like he was still asleep. In hindsight, this was a pointless effort, as the hand only shook him more roughly.

"*Billet, monsieur.*" The man did not look impressed, standing over him wearing a uniform that looked like it had been designed in the 19th century.

Nigel, still operating on road-instinct, did his best to appear groggy even though his senses were alert. This did nothing to help him, however, when he had no ticket to present. The man produced a pad of paper, wrote him a ticket of infraction for 60 euro, and left him alone.

# The Hague

*Cavernous empty ultra-modern city* --- *Ghoulish public art* --- *Buying weed* --- *The Church* --- *Drink, smoke, cry* --- Capital *is my pillow*

# Nothing was the Same

*The revolution in Spain is over* --- *No lessons are learned* --- *Hope remains*
