# At the *péage*

*On the run* --- *The oppressive forest* --- *Barcelona attacks*

The highway broadened out into ten wide lanes of concrete reflecting the August sun. Droning forest crowded in on the asphalt expanse, where Nigel struck an incongruous figure with his backpack. The man crammed into the tiny booth glanced over in his direction. Nigel stuck out his arm. A trucker, already pulling into the right-side lane reserved for large vehicles, beckoned to him through the window. There was a ladder built into the side of the vehicle, and as he stepped into the cab, the driver addressed him excitedly.

"*Il y avait une attaque en Barcelone*." The trucker sat forward over the wheel, a thin shirt hanging off his shoulders. Veins stood out in his arms. The cab was clean and felt sane, unlike most of the cabs Nigel had stepped into before. lean and composed in his equally well-maintained vehicle.

"An attack?"

"Yes, a terrorist attack. They were driving vehicles through crowds in *La Rambla*. It just happened a few hours ago."

The man was excited by the news. He was brimming over with energy describing it.
