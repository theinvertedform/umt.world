The highway broadened out into a dozen lanes as it approached the *péage*. A river of concrete magnifying the August sun, forest droning in on all sides. Nigel stood out in the shimmering heat with his backpack over one shoulder. Encrusted in road grime, he looked backwards as he made his way to a better position. At the end of each lane was a gate and a tiny tollbooth, and crammed into each was a man wearing a yellow vest. One of them looked over at him, eyes white in his black face. Nigel stuck out his arm. A sixteen-wheeler was pulling to the right; its driver beckoned to him from behind the windshield. There was a ladder built into the vehicle's side, and as Nigel climbed up and into the cab, the man started talking immediately.

"*Il y avait une attaque en Barcelone*." The trucker leaned forward over the wheel, t-shirt hanging loose from his lean torso. Veins stood out in his arms. His hair was close-cut and his face shaven. 

"Someone hijacked a van and drove it through La Rambla." The trucker showed a paper to the man in the booth, who peered up at Nigel as he waved them through.

They shifted into gear and accelerated out of the *péage*. "You can put your bag in the back." A curtain separated the cab from a compact, neat little bunk, complete with a reading light and nightstand.

"Who was it?"

"It was an Islamic terrorist. He's still on the run, but he won't get far." The air inside  was cool in the summer heat and smelled like a HEPA filter. It was unlike the hot, reeking cabs of the other trucks Nigel had ridden in throughout Eastern Europe. They were all equally mad, he and the truckers; but France, in all its vanity, trains its citizens to maintain appearances in the name of the motherland. Elsewhere, truth has meaning and form reflects content. The trucker's wired body radiated an unhealthy electric energy. On long-haul journeys, he used a hand-held vacuum to clean the floor, the upholstery of the bench; he wiped down the console and checked the air filter. Then he would take one of the methamphetamine tablets sold at the Lido and prescribed by the company doctor, and drive unblinking through the night.

The trucker fixed Nigel with a stare. "They hate our freedom. Spain has a new party called Podemos. They're just a few years old, and very popular. They're one of the most far-left political parties in Europe. I thought they were going too far. Turns out I'm not the only one."

They listened to news coming over the radio, but Nigel could not follow the presenter's French. The trucker left him outside a small village as dusk turned into gloaming. Nigel spread his groundsheet under the bridge he found, laid down and looked up at its rusty iron girders, the concrete embankment. Where were all those ancient things? This was no different from the undersides of the bridges he had slept under back in the New World. 

When the morning light woke him, he went to sit by himself in the village square. A bakerwoman handed him a *jambon-beurre* with a pitying smile. He waited until she had rejoined the small crowd in front of the cafe, who spoke in low tones and glanced in his direction, before removing the ham and eating his bread and butter sandwich. A blue arrow on a white field pointed the way to the beach, where he found the public showers he had come to expect. The water was cold, filling him with vigorous energy that dissipated as soon as the stream of water stopped. He didn't know where he was, other than the south of France: didn't know the name of the village, couldn't remember which direction he had come from or where he was going when the trucker picked him up. He found his way to the road and stuck his arm out, glancing over his shoulder.

By the time the sun had begun its long descent, Nigel had wound up in the middle of nowhere again. Instead of the claustrophobic heat and din of the *péage*, now it was the silence of rolling hills that weighed on him. Parched grass glowed golden in the afternoon sun. A ruined barn stood nearby, blackened beams casting shadows that crept closer. An hour passed with no traffic. The quiet became more and more oppressive. *I didn't do anything wrong. It's not my fault.*

He saw the car coming before he heard it. Saw it descend one hill, disappear on the ascent, then re-appear, diesel engine buzzing toyfully. It stopped in front of him without bothering to pull over.

"You're a long way from nowhere," the man said as Nigel sat in the passenger seat.

"And the quiet gives me too much time to think."

The man turned his head to see who had entered his car. "Why are you avoiding thought?"

"There's a lot in this world that weighs on me." Nigel did not heed that the car had not yet moved even though the engine was still on. 

"Thought is what makes our lives unique and important. Escaping thought is like running from what makes life essential."

"Harder to say that when all you can think about is loss."

The man seemed satisfied that Nigel was depressed, and therefore not an obvious risk of violent threat.

Nigel had stopped asking for or offering names in his first month of being on the road. The handful he had collected he held onto.

"I spent my whole life in Paris until a couple years ago. Bought a vineyard with some friends and moved out of the city. It took me time to enjoy the quiet, but it helps that farm life is always busy. There's always something to do, there's never time to think. How about you? You speak French, but you have an English accent. You must be Canadian."

"That's right, I live in Montréal. I study philosophy. I'm on month three of my four-month vacation."

"Oh, philosophy! My degree was in environmental studies, but I studied some philosophy, too. Do you know Spinoza? He was important to me because he was an environmental philosopher, centuries before the concept existed. His *Ethics* is what motivated me to organize our farm the way we do. It's a biodynamic system: everything contributes something, and there's very little waste. What's your name?"

"Nigel. Just like Spinoza, I came up with a new name for myself."

"Baruch became Benedictus after he was banished from his community." The man turned his head to look at Nigel again, brows flat.

Some distance later, the man pulled over at a crossroad and they both exited the car. He took a bottle of wine from a box in the trunk.

"Here, take this. A bottle from the vineyard. God will get you where you need to be, Nigel."

"Listen to this," she said. "It's an interview with one of the leaders of Podemos, the socialist party that just got elected in Spain. 'Podemos is a hypothesis. It is possible to build upon the new political space opening in front of us. This is a matter of experiencing society as it is changing in front of you---watching Spanish society change after the *Indignados* movement, developing new ways of framing politics, of feeling politics, even of hating politics...'"

They were lying under her red duvet, mattress on the dark hardwood floor. A lamp and its bare filament bulb cast a warm orange glow in the windowless room. Head cocked, Nigel carefully took note of every keyword he recognized. She kept reading---her lips would not stop moving. She breathed in and out, chest rising and falling beneath her thin night-shirt. A blue flame sparked in his brain and sent his hand toward her; at the same moment, a shadow fell over him, halting his movement before it could begin.

"'There is now a cooperation and a solidarity that didn't exist before these movements, which hadn't existed for years. All this is an inspiration much greater than Marx or Spinoza, though there are people in Podemos with an academic background, like myself. I come from the Critical Theory tradition---from Adorno. Actually my Ph.D. was on Walter Benjamin, so I come from the Critical Theory, Marxist, academic left world. But I have learned a lot from the experience of the last few years, in terms of how social movements and solidarity networks have developed. And my understanding of politics has changed.'[^1]

"Weren't you reading a book by Spinoza?" She turned her head to make eye contact. Her face was still.

"His book on ethics. It's written like a math textbook." Nigel rattled off everything he knew. "He was excommunicated for being too edgy for the religious authority. He was called a Pantheist. He published very little and worked as a lens grinder, which led to him dying young from inhaling glass dust."

"In Europe, our institutions are historically-oriented." Nadine sounded more like she was from Chicago, which she was, than from France, one of the countries which had issued her a passport. "Mass political movements have leaders with PhDs in critical theory. Academics are activists, and vice-versa. In America, you will never catch a politician making historical references."

"That guy's point is that activism led him to a new understanding of philosophy. Just like Marx and Lenin have always said."

"Well you should do more activism. You're not in school. You would get a better understanding of the world if you were out in it."

"I went to the protest, but I never said I was an activist. You're the one in journalism school."

She turned back to her newspaper. Articles could be read at a convenient magazine size, but it needed to be unfolded into a huge square blanket and re-folded into new configurations. He caught sight of the title page: *The Platypus Review*, number 72. "The left is dead."

The shadow spread from his brain down through his neck, turning his blood to ice.

Once more in a village whose name he didn't know, Nigel considered opening the bottle. He would need to find a corkscrew first. Sitting in the grass next to the village roundabout, watching the cars drive around in circles. All roads in France lead back to Paris; at the same time, every village has a miniature version of the *Périphérique*, the immense roundabout circling the city. His mind went back to his arrival in Paris three months ago. He didn't know what to do---had really only come to Europe because he had read about Goethe's *grand tour*, and therefore understood it to be a rite of passage---and so he visited one of the few locations he knew about. The École Normale Supérieur (ÉNS), on the rue d'Ulm, the top school in the country's deeply hierarchical education system, attended by the likes of Sartre, Althusser, Foucault, Derrida, and many other of the most famous French intellectuals who had defined critical theory in the second half of the century. Nigel was there during the off-season. The tall iron gates were locked, and there was no activity to be discerned behind the nondescript building's arched windows.

The bookstore at the corner was also closed. On prominent display in the window were the complete Galimard editions of Spinoza's works, as well as several works of secondary literature: *Expressionism in Philosophy*, *Hegel où Spinoza*, *Spinoza for Our Time*...

Next to the bookstore was a bar. It was open, but Nigel looked on without entering. Even if he had been born in France, he could never have found his way to the country's top school. Would the prospect have motivated him to try? He read books like the *Ethics* without understanding. The words were arranged on the page like bricks in a wall. They concealed something that he could not break through. The wall was enough to confirm the presence something secret concealed behind it, even if he could never catch sight of that ancient wisdom.

*Spinoza, Spinoza, Spinoza.* Sitting there in the village square, unsure of where he was and even less sure of where he was going, the Dutchman's name echoed in his head. It was a sign. Three signs, and therefore a sign from the universe. He lifted his chin and looked in the direction he thought was north: that's where he would go. He would go and visit Spinoza. He didn't know where he was buried, but he could guess that it would be somewhere in the Netherlands. If not in Amsterdam, where the man had lived, then somewhere nearby. There would be time enough to learn.

It ended up taking only three days to get there. First, without intending it, he got a ride into Paris and spent a sleepless night on a bench in the 13th *arrondissement*. In the morning, he spent seven hours on the side of the Périphique trying to catch a ride. It didn't work; exhausted, he paid for a bus ticket to the closest destination outside of the city. Five hours later, in the early evening, he was deposited in the centre of Luxembourg. He boarded the midnight train for The Hague without a ticket. A hand shook him awake. Instinctively, he tried to pretend like he was still asleep. A pointless effort, as the hand only shook him more roughly.

"*Billet, monsieur.*" The man's heavy face was pulled downward from years of shaking awake vagrants. His gold-tasseled uniform looked like an historical artifact from the 19th century.

Nigel, still operating on road-instinct, did his best to appear groggy even though his senses were alert. This did nothing to help him, however, when he had no ticket to present. The man produced a pad of paper, wrote him a ticket of infraction for 60 euro, and left him alone.
