The Crystal Palace was designed by some rough-hewn engineer in hopsack, a rectangular man who elbowed his way to the front of the crowd and, with sweat beading on corduroy brow, drew up his blueprint using compass and square. Before the Palace had even been relocated to where it could burn to the ground, Eiffel had already begun his erection. The two buildings were conceived by the laborious assiduity of men who never in their lives were warmed by the divine spark. They were men who forced their way through the hard ranks of the technical college---unlike the architect, who spent his studies at the Royal Academy in idyll daydream. He had been sat atop his pedestal in calm reverie when the engineers knocked him roughly sprawling to the feet of the mob.

The heirs of these tradesmen are the same ones responsible for the St. Lawrence Warehouse, constructed nearly a century later. Bricked up and windowless, the warehouse is a sealed tomb designed to conceal, whereas the Palace's echoing luminosity was intended to reveal. A sarcophagus, hulking and abandoned above the viaduct where citizens continue to stroll today. The engineer's style is plain geometry, a love of triangles and unadorned materials---a style arrived at through process of elimination; a style that naturally finds its culmination in a spiderweb of warehouses, or an endless chain of electricity towers strung together by thick, buzzing cables. Mini-Eiffels and mini-Palaces spread over the surface of the earth, the crutches that support a world unable to stand on its own. All these electrical towers are now submerged by rising sea levels. Runoff from melting icecaps mingle with another substance: aggressively transparent, thick and viscous like a humour, a crystalline bile that regulates the mood of those who swim through the matrix of the modern world.

Certain members of our species have evolved a secret organ that allows them to breathe through this invisible substance. These are the most advanced specimens, who have grown gills to breathe through the ectoplasm covering the surface of the earth. They have even grown webbed toes and fingers that allow them to swim along the boulevards---to sit and enjoy the sunshine from a park bench, flippered feet stretched out buoyantly before them. These are the blessed ones who don't feel the distance brought on by money, by a screen---by two worlds in imperfect alignment. The transparency of the medium allures Spirit with possibility; *what would it take to break through*?

Work was finished, they had all punched out and were changing shoes for boots, pulling on hats and scarves and coats. L-- asked Marc what he was doing that evening.

"I'm meeting my friend Daniella for dinner, but I don't know if she'll show. I'll just wander around until then and avoid going home. How about you?"

"Well, I'll wait for B-- to finish, then we'll smoke a joint, have a few more beers, as we are normally doing."

L-- smiled easily at Marc and tore on his jacket. The three men had hung around together a few Sundays ago, when the cold wind had blown them through the streets and up into Marc's apartment. The invitation stood open, but A-- stood between them putting on her things innocent as Helen. Those moments were like a knife fight with a combatant who did nothing but feint and smile as though unaware of the blade they were tossing from hand to hand. It was not clear whether his combatant was the man, with whom he imagined himself to be competing; or the woman, the prize that reduced his vision to a point. Those last few blocks were the crucial moment when each would voluntarily prolong their obligatory time together. Out in the street, they could be in private together. There would be a few more laughs before they parted at her corner, and the ambiguity he perceived in her farewell would be enough to occupy him until next Sunday.

He walked down Beaubien into a late winter sun shining low in his eyes, the crowds turned into indistinct silhouettes. Millennials made their name with an aesthetic of nostalgia, the product of growing up during what was then still the ongoing breakdown of linear time. The younger generation grew up amidst the ruins of history, and consequently had evolved a new relationship to authenticity. Millennial aesthetics were eclectic, disorganized and overwhelmed, caught in the trap of irony and unable, unwilling to make any claims to authenticity. The Young Ones made their home in free-fall, plucking preferences suspended in egalitarian stasis, producing a unified aesthetic out of arbitrarily-selected elements. The sun settled below the buildings lining St-Laurent, but the water tower on top of the old brick warehouse was still lit up against the darkening sky.

The door of the cafe scraped against the floor as he entered, a gust of cold air announcing his presence to L--, who stood pouring a cappuccino on the other side of the dark green bar. The room was filled with bare arms defiant against the momentary chill Marc carried with him.

"I'll take a grog, please," he said as he shed his coat and sat at one of the barstools.

L-- stared at him without understanding.

"A *what*?"

"A *grog*," he repeated, hitting the final "g." 

"Ah---a grog. Yes, of course. Sorry, I just didn't understand you."

The drink was hot and spicy. L-- was kept busy by a parade of people wanting to place orders, so Marc had to entertain himself. The crystal bile he clumsily waded through made it impossible to so much as raise his hand in salutation to those around him. He tried to read, but the anxiety of the evening's ambiguity yawned at him. His phone vibrated. It was Daniella.

*what are we doing tonight??*

*it's trivia night at Bishop,* he repeated. *let's go !!*

*i'm down, meet there are at 7?*

*i'll see you there*

After paying L--, Marc said good-bye and paddled off down Bernard. His thoughts took the form of a spiral, the weight of one pulling down on the next so that the whole chain sank lower and lower. How does one relax, he thought, how does one have fun? I have no ideas other than to pay someone to pay attention to me. All this ritual, all this work I set for myself, it's all just a coping mechanism. The ritual is a crutch, marionette strings that keep me upright. 

Each repetition was a prayer keeping away the absence that blacked out the edges of his vision. Sometimes his vision narrowed to a point so fine that he couldn't see a thing. His altered perception could even have the effect of releasing him from gravity's hold. In those moments when he was struck blind, his traction on the world would fade away. He was unable to move forward. The more frantically he paddled, the more he would spin weightlessly in place. Panic rose in his throat, heavy as an anchor, forcing him by iron goad back into gravity's well. Ritual was more reliable than fear as a means to keep him weighted down. In this limbo, he felt more acutely than ever the haunting presence of the Nothing that blackened the edges of his vision.

He kept moving, killing time. It had been much colder when he last saw Daniella. He had visited her at home to pick up a jacket he had left behind at a party so warm and festive, it had brought him out into the cold before he could think of being properly attired. The weeks it took for him to arrange their meeting had been the first seriously cold weeks of the year.

"E-- tried it on. He said the feathers are flat. He said you should put it in the dryer to fluff it up again."

Eventually he wound up at Bishop \& Bagg, where he stood by the door and waited for the server to notice him.

"We're in a bit of a transitional period." She motioned him behind the bar and indicated the screen showing their flooring plan. Her casual familiarity brought the blood to his head, and for a moment he saw the air shimmer between them as when you throw a stone into a still pool. "Most of the room is reserved, but a lot of these people here are about to leave. I'll have a table for you in a couple minutes."

Marc sat at one of the bars that divided the room in two and waited. Two men sat next to him and joined him in waiting. A group of six got up to leave. The server, the tall bartender and their round-faced busboy dragged the tables around, cleaned and re-set each one with water glasses and a QR code.

"You can take either one of these tables," she told him. He took the one next to the window and sat facing the door. It was 7pm. There was no chance Daniella would be on time. He sat on the edge of his seat across from the empty chair as the pub began to fill up, concentrating on not looking at the people around him. Daniella was a valuable friend, but even though she had just texted him that she was on her way, he did not take it for granted that she would actually make it there.

She did, only 20 minutes late.

"Here you go! Happy birthday slash Christmas!" It was January, and he was a Scorpio. She handed him a bag, its contents loosely covered by a single piece of tissue paper.

Inside was a cycling cap with the same logo as the one on the jacket that hung on the chair behind him. It didn't fit, but he was shocked to recognize the label. He had been unsure if she would show up, and here she came with a gift calling back to their history together.

"It's over with E--," she began. "I have to tell you this crazy story." Marc braced himself. "He was texting this girl all day while we're together, but then I got a call from C-- telling me that our friend John died. E-- and I were supposed to hang out at my place alone, but then C--, J-- and M-- came over. We're all grieving together, and meanwhile, E--, who barely even acknowledges the fact that my friend is dead, is still texting this girl. He literally asks me if he can invite her over, so I said yeah, sure, of course."

"Why would you say yes?"

"I wanted to see if he would! And he did, and she comes over. So we're all in my room, and he's just out there making out with her on my couch. At one point she comes up to me and asks if it's okay. And I tell her, I'm ethically non-monogamous, E-- and I are in an open relationship. It doesn't bother me. So my boyfriend is making out with someone else on my couch the same night that I learned that my friend just died. And later that night, when everyone's gone, we had a huge fight. And now we're broken up. Again. But this time it's for real, I swear. You're both Scorpios---explain to me what he's thinking!"

"You're being cruel to him, and he's being cruel back. We Scorpios are called toxic by those who do not understand us, but we are most poisonous towards ourselves. You should do the right thing: take him out back and put a bullet in his head. Start over with someone else and learn from your mistakes. Ethical non-monogamy is a terrible foundation for a relationship. For something casual, sure, whatever---but it doesn't set you up for the big score. I know you want a stable, loving, reliable relationship. I know that you have a hard time letting people go and saying no. But until you learn how to do both of those things, you'll give away too much of yourself. It feels like I'm watching someone self-harm."

At that moment, the music awkwardly broke from background-level classic rock to the first bars of blink-182's "Small Things." Just a snatch at five times the volume, causing everyone in the bar to jump before it dropped back down and the hostess's voice cut through.

"(Sorry about that...) Alright everybody! It's time to get started. For our first question, I'm going to hand out a sheet with pictures of houses. You have to identify what movie or show the houses are from."

"Okay, number five is *Breaking Bad* and number seven is *Twilight*. Or is it *Ferris Bueller*?"

"Can't be---that's an 80s movie, and this is millennial trivia. I say it's *Twilight*."

"Is it really millennial themed?"

"Everyone here is a millennial; they're playing classic millennial music---and every other question has been based on millennial culture."

"Okay, I'm putting *Twilight*."

Electricity moves through the cables suspended between a network of mini-Eiffels, charging the crystal matrix. Bodies hanging in suspended proximity twitch and quiver as though alive. A bubble appears from out of the circuit. "John's died," it said. Daniella's vision narrowed to the point at the end of a telescope.

It turned out that he had died over a month ago, and his parents were only now circulating the news. It had been a month and a half since she last saw him, just before Christmas. Daniella had visited him at home. The condo was brand new and sparkling clean. It could only have been his parents who paid for it, since he didn't work and his art didn't sell. Instead, he spent all day at home, watching movies and painting.

"What have you been up to?" Daniella asked. She opened the glass cupboard, pulled one of four glasses out and filled it from the Brita jug standing on the counter-top. Meanwhile, John sat in the Plang by the window and put his feet up. Daniella took her place on the futon opposite him and looked at her reflection in the dark surface of the TV. The pale yellow light of a floor lamp in the corner lit up their faces with an aggravating lack of shadows.

"I've been working," he said.

"Working---? Where!" For a moment her heart soared at the thought of how much good a job might do him.

"Here---I stopped renting the studio. I figured it was just a waste of money, since I have a spare room here anyway. I'm working on a new series about the female nude in Hollywood cinema."

"Oh, that sounds...so much like you." Of course, he would not actually need to interact with any aspect of the feminine that he couldn't reach from home. She wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be his most successful series yet, based as it was on a lifetime of organic research.

Now he was dead, and who knows what had happened to his paintings. The message came from C--, who knew his parents and was spreading word among his friends. John's parents didn't mention the cause of death, but she speculated on the phone.

"It must have been suicide," said the voice in her ears. Daniella was sitting at her desk at work. Smooth wood, a wireless keyboard and matching wireless mouse, two monitors suspended invisibly in front of her. She sometimes felt air blowing on her legs and guessed that it was her computer, but she never heard it make a sound and never had reason to go looking for it.

"Do you really think he would do that? I spoke to him just a few weeks before he died, he didn't seem suicidal."

"I spoke to him like, two days before he died. He wasn't acting like the Joker or anything, but when I think back, he just seemed so numb---like he was removed from everything. Like he had given up."

"Maybe you're right," Daniella said. She spun the wheel of her mouse, scrolling up and down her spreadsheets. Not looking for anything, just moving the mouse while her mind wandered. The monitor on the left had her boss's expenses, the other had the company's expenses. It was her job to manage the purchasing and to make sure that each expenditure was documented and brought into the equation.

A few more minutes passed before she said goodbye. She tapped the phone lying in front of her to hang up. And now that she was touching it, she might as well pull up her messages and text E--.

"My friend just died. I need to see you tonight."

She called Marc, but as usual he didn't pick up. If she felt numb now, and John had felt numb before he decided to end his life, did that mean she was close to suicidal? The numbness is a bridge between shock and defeat. She could see a whole new territory just beyond.

Hours passed as she sat at her desk, spinning the mouse wheel, occasionally getting up to move around aimlessly and stare blindly at her surroundings. The sun had already set and she knew that outside there was nothing but halogen streetlights shining on dirty piles of snow. Then she found herself at home, with her friends all around her. Eric sat on the white leather couch next to her; Ophelia purred behind them. C-- was in the kitchen making tea.

"You were wanting to be in an open relationship. You wanted me to meet Y--, so it's okay if you meet her, right?" E-- was speaking quietly into her ear. Daniella barely heard him. She didn't understand why he was speaking so quietly. She was still at her desk, scrolling unseeingly through spreadsheets and data forms.

"You're right, it's fine," she said blandly.

C-- entered, and her eyes immediately narrowed when she saw the two of them there. Her friend sat unblinking, staring straight ahead like she had just come back from war while some man she didn't know was curled up next to her, whispering into her ear.

"Here, take this," she said forcefully, shoving the hot mug into Daniella's hands. She sat next to her, using the weight of her body to shift Daniella's centre of gravity on the couch in her direction, away from E--. They made eye contact, and for a moment it seemed like Daniella was looking back at her as though from a great distance.

"Hey," she said, a smile moving her cheeks.

An hour later, there was a knock at the door. E-- jumped up. By that time, M-- and J-- had joined, and the atmosphere was becoming more festive. The Deftones were playing on the stereo, and Daniella was holding forth animatedly to her friends. When E-- re-joined them with the girl he had invited, things took another turn, and the girls retreated into Daniella's room.

"What the fuck is going on out there?" J-- asked.

"More of this open relationship bullshit," C-- said, rolling her eyes angrily. The two were not well-disposed towards their friend's style of relationship-building, even if they were supportive in her efforts to find love. It wasn't that either of them had particular cause to distrust E-- ---sometimes, C-- even felt bad for him. It wasn't his fault, after all; he was just playing along with the terms Daniella set---but she wasn't loyal to him. She thought Daniella ought to lose him once and for all, and then move on to a more healthy and conventional relationship style. But it wasn't for her to say.

"It's fine," Daniella said, fixing her makeup in front of the wardrobe mirror. "I said he could have her over."

"You're fine with your boyfriend making out with some slut, in your apartment, the same day you hear about your friend dying?" J-- said, pulling her head back in from a peek out the door. "Because that's what's happening, girl."

"Really?"

Daniella stuck her head out the door and caught on eyeful of E and the girl, sitting on the couch with faces pressed against each other.

"I mean, what kind of girl even does that?" J-- said, bringing up the obvious.

"I know!" C-- was sitting on the edge of her bed, typing furiously into her phone. Her boyfriend wanted to know what was happening.

***

"It's Spring Break," A-- was saying. "I thought I would do something crazy tonight and go to the cinema."

"Oh---I want to come!" Marc said.

"Okay...well, *Les jours parfait* is playing at 9:10 at Cinema Beaubien. We can meet there at 9 o'clock---sharp! Don't be late."

The snow was falling gently as he walked along Beaubien. The crowds were dispersed, the sun long set. The old couple sat in front of them moved to a seat several rows down because they couldn't stop talking through the previews. The film was written and directed by an old German man, starring an old Japanese man. His character woke up on his tatami mat and watered his plant cuttings. He bought a coffee from the vending machine in the courtyard of his small apartment building, listened to music on cassettes as he drove his van into Tokyo. There, he dedicated himself with loving assiduity to a humble task, sometimes pausing to enjoy the spectacle of sun and wind through the trees. He stayed open to the opportunities for play that emerged out of the unpredictable movements of the city. 

Then the plot picked up; "some people live in different worlds," the old man explained to his niece in one of his few lines of dialogue. She had appeared on his doorstep without warning, fleeing her rich, domineering mother. A man dying from cancer appears, and he and the old man played a game of dancing on each other's shadows. The ending came unexpectedly, but it hit Marc with a force that the ending was there---absent any resolution, the plot having passed like a dream. The close-up image of an old guy hovering on the edge of laughing and crying. A life reduced to nothing but ritual, not through love of it but through necessity. A life completely knocked off balance by the introduction of chaos represented by the niece. This being the basis of life, the lesson of the film is that the man's life was misaligned.

Marc wasn't surprised when, as the credits began to roll, A-- let out an exasperated "*interminable*." Although he had related intensely to the old man living his quiet, lonely life---transplanted from another era, drowning in the modern world of crystal palaces and Eiffel towers. An old man who used ritual to get him through the day: a routine that, once destabilized even by a rising action as subtle as this film's plot, reveals just how precarious a life that lies balanced on external supports truly is. But what kind of life is not balanced by external supports? As they walked down the quiet street, late on a Sunday night, as much as he was focused on following her---as much as he was drowning in the pleasure of their time together---the other part of his mind could not stop. Which part of the man's life was he not supposed to emulate? Which aspect reveals that he was not, in fact, living the good life? Only the final image of a face hovering between crying and laughing.
