## Tuesday

The first principle of our physics is that the world comes after the Fall. You may be so drawn up in the pleasures of the city that you forget. The gaze of an all-seeing eye falls on you. It is not through your present virtue, but through that of your past self that you are privileged to enjoy these diversions: and all privilege comes with a price. 

As dusk comes on, you find yourself passing over the cobbles of a twisted street, eyes alert to movement in air grey like heather. Buildings crowd in on your narrow margin of the road. Nothing breaks the silence, and you make your careful way through the cottony half-light. Something looms behind you. You turn to see a huddling shape, and remark in the gloaming that this shadow bears your likeness. A knobby umbilical cord ties you together. The thing is feeding off you, body made up of the most vulgar substances: legal relations, fiduciary obligations---all the oaths sworn in your name. You look in your twin's uncomprehending eyes and say a prayer: *it is by Your grace that I walk along this twisted passage, and though the darkness bears on me I thank You.* 

Such leech-like creature attach themselves to us from the first moment we cross that invisible threshold drawn in the sand: the line our people used to sketch the borders of the city. The connection between you cannot be broken. The thing might grow fat with years, less willing to move. It might eventually refuse to budge at all, so that if you want to get anything done you must learn to carry its weight. Thus encumbered, the post-lapsarian pleasures of the city draw us more arduously into forgetting. Most of us can manage it at least once or twice while we're still young. 

Life in the city comes with a life sentence constrained to a body of facts that follows you everywhere. In the afternoon, you heat your smallest iron pan over a wire coil, greasing it with salted butter. The white of one cracked egg comes to your garret loose enough to cover the black metal. You select a slice of grill it until the spiral char appears like a brand. As you lick up the spilled yolk, the thing behind you grows tremulous. Congealed ectoplasm sits sluggish in the flaccid tube that hangs between you. Your own emaciated face looks back at you without cognition. Skin pulls against an indissoluble skeletal structure. Feet pound in the stairwell. 

The pounding reaches your door. The thin panel bursts into splinters with little resistance. A jackbooted handler forces its way in. The sexless golem is built of square stone, modernist face carved with straight lines and right angles. An impassive mouth runs parallel to the badge pinned to its wide chest; the gash of its mouth does not move when the voice emerges. 

--- *YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO ACCOUNT. I AM YOUR ACCOUNTANT.* 

The voice is the sound of gravel passing through a hydraulic sieve, broken by static, an amplified discharge loud enough to obliterate thought and leave your ears ringing. The golem's arm extends, sheathed in a leather greave, pinning you painfully against the wall. From your vantage point, you can see through the window, down into the street. A woman cradles her own parasitic double body, thin arms looped around her neck like a child. She perceives your gaze with cat-like intuition, stops suddenly and looks around. 

--- *YOUR OBLIGATION WASTES WHILE YOU GORGE ON ANIMAL PROTEINS. HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR YOUR DERELICTION?* 

“I didn't know,” you say. No-one explained the rules: this burden simply appeared out of the night. 

We are each of us weighed and measured on a Great Ledger in the sky. A disk in a server farm. The memory of the one we want to hear from least. 

As a last resort, the golem will take out its iron truncheon and rain blows on your yielding ribs. This is your first offence, and so the golem tortures you by sticking pins through your wretched double's joints. The pins are contained in a case attached to a cowhide belt, each one six inches of oiled steel. The golem drives them through the double's bone with such force that they nail it to the porous floor. Your second body emits a high-pitched whine, agonized but without understanding. 

# Thursday

Blue light from the screen hits the orange glow of the room. There is a quiet moment---long enough to check my messages. We are not allowed to check our phones at work because the clock wants to extinguish life. When you connect to the outside world, you are defying capital's thanatotic logic. Death is comforting, giving us the easy identity of a corpse. 

*The dog's teeth need to be pulled. You need to pay me back.* She's not even my dog anymore: the news shouldn't affect me, and yet my eyes prick painfully. The bathroom stinks of piss. "I'm taking five." A brisk walk out of view turns into a panicked run around the block. Panting turns into hyperventilation. Heart pounding turns into heart racing.

"Are you okay?" A girl asks me like it's her job. She keeps her distance from me, the guy sitting on the curb, face wet and wringing his hair.

"I'm fine." That's what they taught me to say. They taught me not to say, for example: *No, I'm not okay, do you want to stop and talk about it for a really long time? I'm just dying to unload my pain on someone. A kiss would make me feel better. Maybe we could go out sometime and fall in love?* There is no adjacency more impersonal than between two souls peering at each other through a window in the Great Wall of Public Sociality.

"Thanks for asking," I add. Is that addition a sign that the whole episode is just an act? *She's not even your dog anymore.* So what if she needs to get all her teeth pulled because she has a genetic disease that we didn't catch when she was young. So what if I owe \$4000 to someone whose name triggers a cutscene of Lucifer and the renegade angels falling through darkness, into that infernal pit?

Work becomes an out-of-body experience. The car on autopilot, but self-driving cars are a work-in-progress and it's only a matter of time before I crash. There's something between us. If it's not a bar, it's the page you're holding. A membrane that marks the parasocial. A membrane is a two-way window. It permits ingress and egress. In those moments when an errant personality chooses to defy the channels of monotonous Being, it brings me crashing back into my body like a pleasant surprise. The membrane suffuses the city. It permeates bars, cafes, classrooms; the streets themselves are doused in it. We are all immersed in the amniotic fluid of the economy, but the police know how to massage that body and send bolts of pain screaming through blue light.

# Friday

The first mark of dialogue was her wave. Anyone can wave, but even from a block away I could tell it bore extra significance. It caused the air to ripple. Was there a clue that brought me to judge its significance, or did I make it up in my head? Was it her body language, the way she shifted on the curb towards him; or was it the history of prior waves leading up to that one fateful salute? All these signs and more: relation is a quantum physics, each variable yielding to an infinite regression of quarks and slight smiles.

On my way in, I see her sitting out front of the hairdresser's next door. We met before; like everyone from the salon, she's a regular at the bar next door, where I work. She waves from a distance and I pull to a stop.

"Remind me what your name is?"

"M--," she says. "E-R, but everyone calls me M--. And you're...David, right?"

"David?" I say. "Me, David? No, I'm not a king, but one of his elite soldiers."

"What's going to happen tonight?"

"Nothing special, I don't think."

"Maybe I'll stop by?"

She stops by and sips from a shot glass at the end of the bar. I take the time to polish every fork in the house, in order to keep the chat going. The others pick up my slack, but none of it matters so I don't feel bad.

"Do you have Instagram?"

This is a crucial moment that has failed me before. Through extensive research,I discovered the arcane secret that *girls like Instagram*. The veil of sociality cuts through the harshness of the blue light of the interface; it takes pressure off the individual by embedding communication into a network. *A place for friends.* It's easier because it's less personal. He prefers SMS in principle because it's an open protocol. No-one is incentivized to develop the SMS interface. The things that won't change are the most reliable.

"I don't, I never learned how to use it."

"How do you talk to people?"

"It's hard to make new friends. I have to ask them for their numbers directly. It's usually worth it. It makes things more special."

# Sunday

Life begins in the East, which is yellow, and autumn. Fall is the season of birth, symbolized in its death. Winter comes next, to the North, and it's blue-white, the most fearsome wind of them all. We must make it through the winter to reach the Spring, the West, red: the creative destruction of the Great Conflagration. South is summer, black as ash and hot night. Green sits in the middle, the basic palette that shades all the others.

All these shades that mark the passage of time have become dim in the modern era. Liberal democracy wants everything reduced to the blue light of the interface. Blue casts an unnatural shadow; the eye cannot make out distinctions, and everything is flattened. It is Their preferred colour because it's the one that They can control most easily. The world is become blue; the North Wind runs rampant across the face of the Earth, a destructive force that collapses everything in its path.

The pendulum swings; time passes; things change, but everything remains the same. The spiral tightens. Each new turn of the screw is more punishing than the last.

# Tuesday

The only time he ever called an MP was in 2021, when the Israeli bombardment of Palestine flared up to a new height and was again making international headlines. At the time, he was living in North Vancouver, but his primary residence was still listed as Montréal. He took the opportunity to call the representatives for both ridings; only the office of the Vancouverite called him back, presumably because his suburban constituency had less to worry about. An aide immediately launched into how Hamas started the conflict by bombarding the force-field that covers Israel with their glorified firecrackers.

This week, he called his member of parliament again. Called the office of Rachel Bendayan, the representative of Outremont. Said he wanted to talk to her about her stance on the current events in Palestine.

"Do you live in the riding?" the person on the phone asked me.

"Yes, I do," he responds.

"And you want to know what Ms. Bendayan's position on the conflict is?"

"I *know* what her position on the conflict is, because she has not lost time in making it clear. I want her to be accountable for supporting a genocidal, colonial regime."

"Okay, we'll call you back," the voice said before hanging up abruptly.

There has never been so great a temptation to virtue signal than this past week. Usually he is quite good about not indulging in purely symbolic political acts, but the blue light of the interface is so harsh it can print its own vision of the world onto the perceptual apparatus.

Of all the conflicts, all the wars, all the barbaric regimes, what makes him feel so strongly about this one? He knows little about it. Doesn't even know many of the details relevant to the present, because the one thing he is certain of is that the shadow-play coming through the interface is a false image of reality.

Is it some form of racism that makes him feel for the Palestinian people? A fetishistic over-compensation? Orientalism? Anti-Semitism? Displacement of energies from the local to the international, whose abstract stage is a way to avoid culpability for the local?

***

Arts and crafts were never his metier. He bought a foam board from the dollar store, roughly hacked it in half so the edge was ragged and frayed. Tried nailing it to a hollow metal broom stick, but that didn't work. Tying it at top and bottom with a piece of twine kept it in place. One side reads: *FREE PALESTINE*; the other, *ISRAEL = APARTHEID STATE*. The plan is to walk from the Mile End to Dorchester Square, where the rally is being held. When stepping out the door, hit with the reality of the world, the prospect of walking down Parc Ave (his usual route) and straight through the heart of the Hasidic neighbourhood feels too confrontational, so he takes St-Urbain instead.

Blue light is harsh on the eyes. It casts an unpleasant shadow-vision of the world that one is led to believe is a true representation of reality. This blue shadow-world is cut through by a jagged curl of barbed wire over whose top opposing sides emerge in combat. A never-ending trench warfare that plays out in the false reality of a shadow world. The blue light of the interface is another parasocial membrane---like the bar, the cafe, the classroom, the city street; but here we only look voyeuristically at the image of another. This harsh image of reality is not an accidental thing. It is a false reality that corporations and states are incentivized to create for themselves. An image of the world as poisonous as the blue light we perceive it by.

The rally is an antidote to this false image of reality. It's real. I meet a friend whose baby is strapped to her chest. She looks at me mutely, eyes wide open. I can't imagine how overstimulating this crowd of shouting, cheering, waving people festooned in all manner of colour must be to her. She doesn't comprehend, and therefore is unfazed by it, doesn't cry once. He makes eye contact with the baby for a moment, but then she passes on to the next blob of colour. Her pupils are dilated, it looks like she's tripping.

Nietzsche said that the Western subject has been dislocated from its roots. I felt this at the rally when a friend made me carry his Irish flag (he already had one in each hand). Several Palestinians hailed me for it, and I felt the allure of a root. A meaning beyond myself. Historical continuity. An identity beyond my role in the machinery of capitalism; beyond that flimsy one I have built for myself. The colour that stands out to me most in the Irish flag is the *orange*, perfect antagonist to our enemy blue.

A slogan coming out of the Cultural Revolution in China is that *it is right to rebel*. But it is not right for Israel to rebel against the sovereignty of Palestine. If we are looking for something that is "beyond critique" in the sense of impervious to it---something that cannot be criticized---then we can't grant this one without admitting to hypocrisy.

Lenin says that "it is not enough to take sides on the questions of political slogans; it is also necessary to take sides on the question of an armed uprising." The more-or-less consensus view in communist theory is that violence is necessary if you are going to do a revolution, because the enemies of the people are very happy themselves to deploy violence. If an oppressed group, such as a colonized people (or the proletariat) take up arms in their process of self-determination and you fail to support them in doing so, then you have taken a side against their self-determination. Writing from this arrogant perspective pumps me up, and for a moment I feel like I have landed somewhere beyond critique.

A pedantic counter-argument is that, under a dictatorship of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie become an oppressed group and we have no interest in granting them self-determination through any means. We need a dictatorship of the proletariat *yesterday*. There is a one-sidedness here that the bourgeoisie can criticize if they are willing to sacrifice their humanity and affirm their status as enemies of the people.

Is the principle of solidarity beyond critique? For Schopenhauer, compassion for other living creatures is the only sound principle in a life whose fundamental characteristic is suffering. Sounds nice, but unfortunately suffering comes in the form of political contingencies. I will not publicly express solidarity or compassion for Israel. How I feel on the matter of killing is a private affair. Here in public, to express sympathy for either individual Israelis or the state of Israel is equivalent to politically supporting the state of Israel, which I condemn in the strongest possible terms. This is a highly toxic situation for everyone, but it's the blue image of the world Israel has selected as representative of reality. It's not hard to imagine a situation in which we could criticize an expression of solidarity.

The only thing I can think of that is beyond critique is something contrary to what I understand as the ethos of this class (not to mention Marxism). It is also something that I am not sure how to philosophize, fixated as I am on the division between private and public. It is the sacredness of the Existing One. The individual. Yes, existentialism was my entry into philosophy, as it is with most boys; and I retain some element of that in my heart. My understanding of how we understand the world in this class is something like---a connected process of movement, where the past echoes through the present and is felt in the future. No-one is an island; we are each of us made by the environment, even if we all exceed our economic facticity, or whichever other environment interpellates us. Is this a ground where we can find the sacredness of the individual? Every individual is worth as much as any other; no individual is beyond redemption (?); no individual "I" can be reduced to the collective "We". It is only at the level of the individual that we can find a firm enough footing to stand beyond critique. Of course this leaves wide open the question of *what an individual is.*
