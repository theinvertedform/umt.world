## Sunday

Children cry upon waking, dragged unwilling to face the day. Men with uneven temperaments wake up bitter and relationships fall apart at the seams. The devout recall a prayer to mind immediately upon waking, a habit to soothe the spirit's anxious passage back into whatever fallen form the world has forced it into.

In place of a beneficent ground, your body's habit of shame determines your first thought: *what terrible thing did I do last night*? Forests burn on the edge of the city. From the top of the viaduct, when the light is low, you can make out the fire's distant glow on the horizon. The sun is a smudge that tints the sky a hellish orange.

Shame berates you into facing the day. The blows of its iron truncheon drive you out of bed, into the kitchen of your garret. Shame and embarrassment are positive indications that you went outside yourself: *if I saw her, she saw me.* Absent God or love, repetition is the only thing that grounds you.

You open a cupboard and pull out the scale, a bag of coffee beans, paper filter and the plastic cone it sits in, together with a hand grinder. The smell inside their bag is like warm-roasted, sulfurous loam; like something that grows under cumulus clouds in the rich black earth on the slope of a volcano. The last bean crushes into an even powder under the grinder's burrs. You dampen the filter in its plastic funnel, position it over the mug, level the grounds and tare the weight. With the goose-neck spout of the kettle you evenly dampen the grounds. Gas bubbles form and disappear on the surface. You pour the rest of the water and top the mug with milk.

Out on the stoop in the hazy light, you whisper her name gingerly into the black surface of your phone: *J--*. The screen stays dark; instead, the previous night's moment of failure appears like a hologram projected before you. She saluted you, and on passing you valiantly resisted turning your head. You've been at the party for an hour, and in that time have already observed everyone there and rendered your silent judgement. You are here to be in proximity to others, and yet they don't interest you. The room changes when she shows up, narrow features occasionally illuminated by the flashing lights. She interests you, but you avoid her. You're close enough to hear her voice as she talks to another man. You have proven yourself independent, and your reward is the independence that greets you day after day.

## Tuesday

*Hegel* in the Winter semester. Two and a half hours every Tuesday night for thirteen weeks in the basement of a lesser mall on Sainte-C--, partly converted into classrooms. Students sit at benches next to fake greenery, chatting, studying, eating from take-out containers while the downtown homeless drift like wraiths amongst them.

The escalator to the basement is broken, the stairs trafficked by parallel streams of blank-faced Preterites. A boy turns his head towards you. Two silver ingots have been driven into his eyes. Black blood stands thick on his cheeks. He disappears into the cold.

At the bottom of the stairs, a troupe of girls practise a dance routine in front of the mirrored wall. Unfamiliar electronic music echoes distorted through the dim light. The smell of rotting garbage mingled with sewage hits you as you turn into the main passage way. Garbage from the food court is stored in chambers adjoining the classrooms. The passage opens into a cavernous atrium, stench and shadow mingling in a maleficent gathering hall where students sit uneasily at tables too tall for the built-in benches. A puddle spreads from the blocked drinking fountain. Trash bins overflow with empty cans of Monster, Styrofoam containers coated in red and orange grease. Week after week, you notice the same toilet stall is silently occupied, the same pair of shoes visible under the door.

The lecture hall is wide and narrow, students compressed into vertiginous tiers. A far-off din of amplified voices comes muffled through the white walls. Professor A-- tumbles into her lectures breathlessly, moving unpredictably from opening remarks into a hectic stream of exposition. Along the way, she makes extensive use of the blackboard. Entire sentences are transcribed, then gradually over-written with arrows connecting one keyword or paragraph number to another.

It takes a few repetitions before you began to notice J--. You sit behind her and can't avoid seeing the screen of her ThinkPad. Nor the back of her neck. The same model as yours, but newer. She's younger than you. Yours is old and you try not to let it leave your desk anymore. The first time she pulls up her browser, the New Tab page gives you something to think about. Loud green text reminds you both to “close this page and go back to what you were doing! :)”

Dirty snow impedes traction out in the constant night. A feeble sun rises late and sets early, clouded by an endless snow front. Tuesday is spent inside white and blue plastic rooms lit by fluorescent bulbs. It is your habit to snap up any chance to hold yourself at a distance from others---until you are brought to a crossroads by the New Tab page. It renders you uncharacteristically neutral. Her screen doesn't move often enough to distract you because she's a better student than most. She and Professor A-- will occasionally interact as though no-one else were present. Before you become consciously aware of her, your body has perceived itself reflected in her---in how she holds herself apart from others---how she speaks only infrequently---how she looks at you curiously.

The RealTree hoodie that swaddles her belongs to one of your favourite trends. When she wears the hood up, you can't see the back of her neck. She has to fight to keep her body warm. You stand in the freezing wind, praying for it to blow you away. Each time you delay your judgement of her, you keep yourself from sinking deeper into the soft foam of cynicism. What paths does she take through the rest of her life?

The *Phenomenology* begins with “Sense-Certainty,” a form of knowledge that comes immediately at the first moment of consciousness. Upon waking, you stand for a moment on a precipice; and when you plunge into the next moment, your Being settles into place. Immediacy becomes an object for you: you are moving through time. Dirty snow leads to forest fires. The devout recall a prayer to mind, a passageway to sooth our anxious passage from innocence to our fallen state: *My God, the Soul!*

E--'s soft leather pencil case lies on the desk between you. He uses a new-looking silver Macbook. Your long hair is dissimilar to his shaved pate. His designer accoutrement belies the modesty of his speech. The class is a potent concentration of youthful sincerity that becomes rare when diluted among the general population.

“The chapter progresses through two stages,” he says, “but doesn't give a name for them. I think of them as the ‘mature' and ‘immature' stages of sense-certainty. The movement doesn't happen through mediation, because sense-certainty is immediate. The linguistic operation of designating something the ‘This' allows consciousness to progress from immature to mature.”

It's early enough in the semester that class dynamics have not fully concretized, and you are able to speak. “I like the terms mature and immature,” you say, alternating between eye contact with Prof A-- and E--, “because the movement in this section is temporal, like the process of maturation. Sheer being is as young as you can be, conceptually speaking. At that moment, you exist without mediation. But for consciousness to have a concept of that moment, some amount of time must have elapsed. Consciousness exists in time before it begins to conceptualize itself in language.” J--'s posture relaxes after you finish speaking.

E-- walks among us as an aristocrat walks in disguise among the rabble, observing their sufferings in order to thereby better rule them. You are the rabble: this is how you suffer. Months have passed since “Sense-Certainty.” After you whisper her name into your phone, you head to work without eating, hoping that the hunger will be sufficient penitence. At work, the windows are left wide open, inviting a breeze to stir the hot air. The smell of smoke is too woodsy to come from the tavern's kitchen. You show a group to their table. They treat you with the professional insouciance that only the French possess: an aristocratic detachment from earthly concerns, as though all is given by divine right. She's heavily tattooed and dressed casually in sportswear. A mandala inked into her skin emerges from the top edge of the sports bra she wears as a top.

J-- pivots in the tier below you, chair shrieking until she's parallel to the blackboard. She makes sideways eye contact with you. “Even though we're talking about the birth of consciousness, he's writing in the first person, so the question of origin doesn't come up. What you said about the temporal dimension of sense-certainty foreshadows a critique of divine origin. Sheer being doesn't fall away into anything absolute; there's no God there. I want to know more about the ground that consciousness rises out of.”

She remains in profile, dividing her attention between you and Professor A--, who she addresses as a proxy for the thirty other people in the room.

Your pupils contract as you move from the dark interior out into the scorched street. The sun has burned away the smoke and replaced it with the standard smog. The woman with the mandala meets your eye only when she wants water, a serviette, and you bow obsequiously to her summons. You can't stop looking at her. A Lord gains strength from their bondsman's doting, but this relation of dependence eventually gives way to a reversal. Your judgement of others and the distance you maintain lets you feel haughty and inviolate. As she's leaving, she catches your eye. There is the faint, playful gleam of acknowledgement in her eye. Desire is a hall of mirrors, a recognition of the self in the other---an infinite regression of your own image.

The sun is still in the sky when you leave work. You find the closest patch of grass and kneel, facing East into a brick wall. *God's love, not a girl's.* You take out your phone and look at your reflection in its dark surface. *J--*, you whisper for the second time that day, and wonder if it was all your imagination.

## Tuesday

As you scurry back through the stinking halls after class, out into the slush and dark, V-- is waiting for you next to the stagnant lake.

“I have your book. I wanted to give it back,” she says with downcast eyes. If you could take her chin in your hand, raise her face and examine it---you would see nothing but this poor woman standing before you. You catch no reflection of yourself: no hint of desire's branching connection.

“Okay, fine, I'll take it,” you bite off, disinterested. Your thoughts are still on sense certainty. The confidence of your body's knowledge fades. What did you see in J--'s profile? How can you interpret a stranger's vocabulary of gestures---unsaid, yet semi-actualized through minute gestures? Your entire existence lies unsaid. V-- insists that she has observed you as carefully as you observe others; that she has interpreted the meaning behind your gestures, something no-one else does.

She pulls a paperback copy of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* from her backpack. “I know it means a lot to you.”

“Well---I wasn't reading it, I just like having it around.” These days it's the *Phenomenology* that obsesses you, your wired nerves sharpened on its maze of clauses.

“Can we talk?” you hear her whisper.

Your jaw clenches and you resist grinding your teeth. “We've been over this. I'm sorry for what I did to you. I'm trying to move on. You need to move on, too.” You catch sight of yourself next to her in the mirror where the troupe gamboled in careful synchronicity. The mall is deserted, only a few straggling students bracing themselves for the cold. What if someone sees you together?

“I love you. You need it. Why won't you let me?” You're three steps up the stairs when she says this, hasteful to fly into the anarchic night. You look back at her. She fiddles with the sternum strap of her backpack, head angled up at you, eyes still downcast. Her voice is tremulous. “I left T--.”

“You shouldn't have. I was leading you on. I told you so. It was cruel of me. All I could think to do was lay the whole thing bare, and then to extricate myself. That's what fired your passion, V--. It's a classic manipulation pattern that I unconsciously fell into. I offer you my accountability, whatever that might look like---but it's not going to be in the form you want.”

The second principle of our physics is that the events of the Book of Revelation have already transpired. Our city is an island surrounded by fire. This winter is the nuclear winter that follows Apocalypse. We who survive are animated by routine, love, faith: shadow puppets painted on blasted walls.

“But what about me? What about my choices? I am not so naive as you think. I was already unhappy with T--. You gave me the perspective I needed to leave an unhappy relationship that otherwise, I might have stayed in forever. For that I will always love you.”

“That's fine, but you can't keep afflicting me with your wounded eyes, your constant messaging. It's not doing anything.” You itch to turn away. She advances one step towards you.

“I sit behind you in class. I see you watching everyone else. I see you taking notes. I see how you stay on the outside. I know you're lonely, but you don't have to be. I forgive you for whatever you think you did to me. You deserve love.”

## Tuesday

You don't post your Hegelian poems on the class message-board, and you don't give a presentation. Instead, as the weeks pass, you sink deeper and deeper beneath the surface. Looking down your nose helps you from feeling bad. V-- is in the offshoot of the class's dominant in-group. J-- is a *de facto* member, but you don't hold it against her. They wear the typical anachronistic combination of Y2K futurism and mallcore, arrive late to class in pairs and grouplets, talking loudly and holding up the rest. You don't give them the same benefit of the doubt as you do her. Their overbearing candour is, as Kant would say, the product of an immaturity that does not heed the distinction between public and private. E-- is the only other one that you hold in esteem: he does an excellent job keeping one foot in and one foot out.

One Tuesday evening, you notice she's had her nails done. Weeks have passed. The snow has compressed, the night grown more frigid. Out of the drapery of her hoodie, her fingers are now adorned with acrylic nails, clear, square, purple-tipped. Your awareness moves from subterranean out into he light of consciousness. Desire is no longer an invisible tectonic force, but now has become a real wind that stirs the surface of your living body. Purple is *your* colour. The New Tab page was girlish, but this is womanly.

In the months since the end of *Hegel*, you tried to forget about her, assuming you would never meet again once school was out. Then you saw her on Friday night in that square kilometre you dream of so frequently. The sight of her brought you back to the darkness of winter that hangs over your bed, a cloud in the brightness of early summer--- but it also recalls when your life briefly had meaning---when you had a prospect, even if unattainable. Like the sun, or God, a girl's affection warms you, pulls you into orbit. Noticing her nails one day; noticing the way she moved her hair and drew her fingertips along the back of her neck. These moments begin to form beats in the story you tell yourself. Your reflection in her eye contains a miniature image of her, but does she perceive it?

The sun shines cheerily that Monday morning. You wake up stressed and famished, rising straight away and with vigour. Measure the beans, grind the beans, pour the water, out on the stoop in the nightmare of reality. You raise your phone.

“*J--*,” you whisper her name for the third time. The screen lights up and she swims into view. Her avatar is a cloud in a grey-blue sky.

You press the message icon.

*I sat behind you in Hegel class. I thought your New Tab page was cute. I saw you the other night and wanted to say hi, but it looked like you were with someone.*

Did she ever notice your dark mood, or the attention you paid towards her? You press send and straighten your back. After the long dark winter, the sun coaxes life out of the bud. Like God, reliable, governed by immutable laws. A girl's love is a poor substitute for the divine, and you don't have that---just a possibility.

## Now

The phone rasps in your hand as though upon response, and you almost drop it. It delivers a message from E--.

“Meet me at Gallery K. at 7pm.”

The gallery is just a narrow room on P-- Avenue, divided into two floors by a mezzanine and not much larger than the attic crawlspace you inhabit. The crowds sit out on the steps leading down to the fabric store that occupies the basement unit, thick enough to cut the reader into a disembodied voice. Four lanes of traffic roll by, unperturbed cars with their windows down; pedestrians look in wonder at the solemn crowd of eccentric rarities, each one silent, staring at their feet while a faint voice chants in a strange diction.

J-- wears a black t-shirt tucked into wide blue dungarees, thin gold chain hanging low from her neck. You salute her from across the crowd. E-- manipulates the waves until you find yourself standing next to her, your backs against the road.

“Why didn't you say hello if you wanted to?” Her face belies nothing. “Seeing you brought me back to that pit. I became frozen and unable to move.” “Oh,” she says. “It's been months since that class ended. Everything has changed. What do you know about me?”

“Nothing, really, other than what I observed sitting behind you for thirteen weeks.” She laughs and ice sloughs off your frozen eaves.

“Who were you talking to the other night?”

She looks away. “That was my boyfriend.”

The midsummer sun is setting, the sky's cheek is blushing pink. A light rain mists you, cooling the crowd spread under the juglans tree. The air has cleared of smoke, and the city releases its petrichor, intoxicating you with a perfume of wet concrete and lilac. A smattering of applause ripples for the final poet.

“This was a beautiful evening thanks to you all, and thank you for coming,” Z-- says into the microphone, giving permission for the crowd to disintegrate. J-- begins to look around. Through her opacity, you perceive a glimmer of invitation. It's a part of you that you see in her. Desire bounces between mirrored surfaces, growing more frantic with repetition. Opportunity has passed your lap without you earning it. The city, in all its quaking dynamism, threw this up in your lap. You have not changed--- you don't deserve this; and as the sky becomes streaked with mauve, you recede back into yourself.
