title: The Path to Self-Consciousness
description: Fear of life at the moment between sleep and waking.

---

Children cry upon waking, dragged unwilling to face the day. Men with uneven temperaments wake up bitter and relationships fall apart at the seams. The devout recall a prayer to mind immediately upon waking. A habit to soothe the spirit's anxious passage from deathlike sleep back into the waking world. Prayer grounds the spirit before it has a chance to settle into whatever fallen form the chaotic world has forced us into. 

In place of a grounding prayer, your body's habit of shame determines your first thought: *what terrible thing did I do last night*? You and the rest of the city are dragged unwilling into air turned grey and sky turned orange from the forests burning outside town. Frustration chokes you. A power that wants to reach outward, suffocated, collapsing into self-negation.

The shame berates you into facing the day. It drives you out of bed after a struggle, down the hall and into the kitchen. Sometimes shame is a positive indication that you went outside yourself. *If I remember her, she can remember me.* The beer was not enough to substitute for your spinelessness. You give the cat a pet down his back. Sometimes it's impossible to rise, without God or love incapable of becoming an actual person. The shame berates you into facing the day.

You open a cupboard and pull out the scale, a bag of coffee beans, paper filter and the plastic cone it sits in, together with a hand grinder. Inside their paper bag the smell is like warm-roasted, sulfurous loam; like something that grows under cumulus clouds in the rich black earth on the slope of a volcano. The last bean crushes into an even powder under the grinder's burrs. You dampen the filter in its plastic funnel, position it over the mug, level the grounds, and tare the weight. The kettle has a goose-neck spout, so you can evenly dampen the grounds. Gas bubbles form and disappear on the surface. You pour the rest of the water and top the mug with milk.

Out in the bright light and warm morning air on the front stoop, you whisper her name into your phone. *J--*. The screen stays black, and instead the previous night's precise moment of failure appears like a hologram projected before you. She saluted you across the crowd, and you returned the gesture. On passing, you bravely resisted turning your head towards her, valiantly proving your cool independence. The room is different now from when you went out for a smoke. She's there, occasionally lit up by the flashing lights. You have already made a judgement on most of these people, and dismissed them. Not her. You're close enough to hear her voice above the DJ as she talks to another man.

*Hegel* in the Winter semester. A thirteen week course on Tuesday nights, from 18h--20h15 in the basement of the FG building. A lesser mall on Ste-Catherines partly converted into classrooms. Students sit at benches next to fake greenery, chatting, studying, eating their take-out meals while the downtown homeless drift like wraiths amongst them. 

The escalator into the basement is broken, leaving the stairs trafficked by parallel streams of blank-faced Preterites. A boy turns his head towards you. Two silver ingots have been driven into his eyes. Black blood stands thick on his cheeks. 

A troupe of girls practise dancing in front of the mirrored wall at the bottom of the stairs. Unfamiliar electronic music echoes distorted through the shadows. The smell of rotting garbage mingled with sewage hits you as you turn the corner into the main passageway. Garbage from the food court is stored in chambers that adjoin the classrooms. The hall opens into a cavernous atrium, stench and shadow mingling in a maleficent gathering hall where students sit uneasily at tables too tall for the built-in benches. A puddle spreads from the blocked drinking fountain. Trash bins overflow with empty cans of Monster and Styrofoam containers coated in red and orange grease. You notice, week after week, the same toilet stall is always silently occupied, the same pair of shoes visible under the door.

The lecture hall is wide and narrow. A far-off din of amplified voices comes muffled through the white walls. Professor A-- tumbles into her lectures breathlessly, moving unpredictably from opening remarks into a rushing stream of exposition. Along the way, she makes extensive use of the blackboard. Entire sentences are transcribed, then gradually over-written by arrows connecting one keyword or paragraph number to another. 

The syllabus divides the *Phenomenology of Spirit* over twelve weeks, omitting a few sections including "Force and the Understanding." The third chapter is the third moment in the book's opening dialectical synthesis. It is the stage in consciousness' development wherein it begins to respond to the world outside itself. You can see the Miller translation's iconic yellow-and-gold cover from where you lie paralyzed in bed, famished and unable to rise.

It takes a few rotations before you began to notice J--. You sit behind her in class and can't avoid seeing the screen of her ThinkPad. Nor the back of her neck. The same model as yours, but newer. She's younger than you. Yours is old and you try not to let it leave your desk anymore. When she pulls up her browser for the first time, her New Tab page gives you something to think about. Loud green text reminds you both to "close this page and go back to what you were doing! :)" 

Dirty snow impedes traction out in the constant night. A feeble sun rises late and sets early, clouded by an endless snow front. Tuesday is spent inside white and blue plastic rooms lit by fluorescent bulbs. It is the habit of your hardened heart to snap up any chance to hold yourself at a distance from others---but confronted by her computer screen, you remain uncharacteristically neutral. It doesn't flash up often enough to bother you. She's a better student than most. She and Professor A-- have a great deal of esteem for each other. Before you become consciously aware of her, your body has perceived itself reflected in her eye; in the way she holds herself apart from others---in the way she looks at you curiously, and most especially in the way she remains silent.

The hoodie she wears most weeks is patterned with hunting camo, a trend you like. When she wears her hood up you can't see the back of her neck. She wants to stay warm and hidden, more than she wants to stay. Each choice to be charitable keeps you from sinking lower into the soft foam of cynicism. What paths does she take through the rest of her life?

The book begins with "Sense-Certainty," the knowledge that comes immediately at the first moment of consciousness. The moment of awakening is a moment of *sheer being*; when we pass to the second moment, that point of immediacy becomes an object for consciousness. We notice our movement along the temporal axis. E-- calls these two moments the "mature" and "immature" stages of sense-certainty. 

"The chapter progresses between two stages," he says, "but that movement doesn't happen through mediation because sense-certainty is immediate. When consciousness looks at the 'This,' it moves between these two stages based on a linguistic operation. That's the best I can make of it."

His soft brown leather pencil case lies on the desk between you. He uses a thin and new-looking silver Macbook. Your long hair is dissimilar to his shaved pate. All his designer accoutrement belie the modesty of his speech. The class is filled with powerful characters, a potent concentration of youthful sincerity that you know is rare when diluted among the general population.

"I like the terms mature and immature, because the movement in this section is temporal, corresponding to stages of maturity. In that moment of sheer being, we exist without mediation. But for consciousness to refer to that moment, there's an implied moment of time that passes---the time it takes to point to 'This' is what leads to the development from immature to mature sense-certainty. It's a question of time, rather than language."

E--'s presence has the quality of a *fl√¢neur* walking in disguise among the hoi polloi, to see how the rabble suffer and thereby to better rule them. You are the hoi polloi: this is how you suffer. You don't eat anything with your coffee and go to work hungry and stressed. The windows are all wide open in hopes of a breeze to stir the hot air standing still. You show a group to their table on the wooden terrace built into the curb. They treat you with a professional detachment passed down from an aristocracy ordained by divine right. Incongruously for a French princess, she's dressed in sportswear and heavily tattooed. Her chest is covered by a mandala and partially covered by the sports bra she wears as a top in the heat. The tattoo operates in contrast with the covering, implying what is concealed. The tattoo is erotic because it does not reveal itself fully, but maintains a part of itself concealed.

J-- pivots, chair shrieking, so that she is parallel to the blackboard and can make eye contact with you.

"It's important what you said about sense-certainty, because it gives us a way to understand what's wrong about this idea that sense-certainty falls away into something absolute---something spiritual, that could take the place of God."

She remains in profile, dividing her attention between you, to whom she is responding; and Professor A--, who she addresses as a proxy for the 30 other people in the room.

She meets your eyes only when she wants something, and you bow obsequiously in reply. You can't stop glancing at her. The aristocracy, demi-gods as they are, gain their power from worship. You need to be around people to feel alive; they need you to be around in order to live. As they're leaving she catches your eye, and for a fraction of a second you see yourself staring back at you. A cute *salut* and she's gone. The sun is still up when you leave work. You find the closest patch of grass and kneel, facing East and a brick wall. *God's love, not a girl's.* You take out your phone and look at your reflection in its dark surface. *J--*, you whisper for the second time that day, and wonder if was all just something you imagined.

As you scurry back through the stinking halls, heading out into the slush and dark, V-- is waiting for you next to the stagnant lake.

"I have your book. I wanted to give it back," she says, not looking at you. She won't admit that she's afraid of you, so you just feel bad around her while she cowers like an abused housewife in a 50s melodrama.

"Okay," you bite off, disinterested. Your thoughts are still somewhere else. What did you see in J--'s profile? It does not occur to you to wonder *why are you thinking about someone who is not here, rather than the one who is?* How can you trust yourself to interpret a stranger's vocabulary of gestures---all those unsaid, yet expressed and therefore semi-actualized emotional energies, flowing, prodding you this way and that? Your entire existence lies unsaid. And yet, V-- is still here, trying to capture your attention.

She pulls your copy of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* out of her backpack. A book you often used to reach for when waking up stressed from sleepless nights. Wracked with anxiety last year, you ran to the bookstore clutching a copy of *Repetition*. Nowadays the *Phenomenology* obsesses you, your wired nerves sharpening on the edges of its maze of clauses, so you loaned it to V-- when she asked without asking if she reached for it out of the same desperation that you did.

You observe the class society from behind. J-- is a *de facto* member of the in-group, but you don't hold it against her. Young and conspicuously attired, they usually arrive late, seven of them talking loudly about their personal lives. You don't give them the same benefit of the doubt as you do her. Their overbearing candour is, as Kant would say, the product of an immaturity that does not heed the distinction between public and private. Propriety is not just an impossible gulf, but an undesirable one. The young one is still in the process of forming a single identity, much less a bifurcated one. 

D-- is the tribe's benevolent chieftain. She grew up on St. Clair, near where you grew up on the East side of Toronto. Most Torontonians you meet are from the West side. Despite this geographic parallelism, your socio-economic backgrounds are entirely dissimilar. She repeats the same anecdote two meetings in a row, as though it were still new. Your judgement settles into place. You can't respect anyone who shows such little respect towards you. She chats with you during the break if there's no-one else around. 

They don't know anything about you because you never speak. You don't post your Hegelian poems on the class message-board, and you don't give a presentation. Instead, as the weeks pass, you sink further and further beneath the surface. D-- doesn't retain anything about you because Your personality is so feeble. Looking down your nose helps you from feeling bad. E-- is the one you hold in esteem; he does an excellent job keeping one foot in and one foot out. You can see it so clearly from your position just behind.

One Tuesday evening, you notice she's had her nails done. Weeks have passed. The snow has compressed; everything has become more intense. You notice something different. Out of the drapery of her hoodie, her fingers are now adorned with acrylic nails, clear, square, and purple-tipped. Your awareness moves from subterranean out into he light of consciousness. Desire is no longer an invisible tectonic force, but has become a real wind stirring the surface of a living body. Purple is *your* colour. The New Tab page was girlish, but this is feminine: yes, she *is* a woman.

In the months since the end of semester, you tried to forgot about her. Assumed you would never meet again once school was out. Then you saw her on Friday night at your favourite late-night spot. A callback to the darkness of winter still hanging over your bed, a cloud in the brightness of early summer---but it also recalls when your life briefly had meaning; when you had a prospect. Like the sun, or God, a girl's affection is a source of warmth that draws you into its orientation. Noticing her nails one day; noticing the way she moved her hair and her nails along the back of her neck. These moments begin to form beats in the story you tell yourself. Your reflection in her eye implies that you are also mirroring her image back at herself. Desire illuminates the surface of the scrying pool.

The sun is shining on Monday morning. You wake up stressed and famished, give the cat a pet and rise straight away. Measure the beans, grind the beans, pour the water, out on the stoop. You raise your phone.

"*J--*," you whisper into it for the third time. The screen lights up and her name swims into view. Her avatar is a picture of a cloud in a grey-blue sky. Another sign under the same aspect.

You press the message icon.

*I sat behind you in Hegel class. I thought your New Tab page was cute. I saw you the other night and wanted to say hi, but it looked like you were with someone.*

Did she ever notice your dark mood, or the attention you paid towards her?

You press send and straighten your back. After the long dark winter, the sun is a powerful enticement to rise. Like God, reliable, governed by immutable laws. A girl's love is a poor substitute for the divine, but it'll do today.
