Unbroken sprawl separates Santa Barbara from Greater Los Angeles, but one can travel between the two counties by transferring from one city bus line to the next. Downtown is paved with glazed brick, smooth and glassy and red as terracotta faded pale by the Western sun. The bricks are laid following a pattern carefully engineered to eliminate visible irregularities; concrete joinery is measured with laser precision, resulting in a surface as smooth and level as asphalt.

As the sun was breaking over the bay, Nigel walked along the damp-dew bricks of De La Guerra Street. He paused next to a discount clothing store and hitched the belt on his backpack, moving the weight off his tired shoulders and onto his hips. The street opened up ahead; he kept walking, marvelling along the way at the shape of the fire-hydrants, the curved porticos of the colonial architecture.

The sound of traffic on the freeway washed over him as he turned the corner. There appeared the oceanic parking lot so typical of California: an empty expanse peopled, at this early hour, by only three vehicles in the employee section. The discount grocery depot was open. Its bright lights pierced the early morning air.

Nigel grabbed a cart and threw his backpack down onto the undercarriage, then leaned low over the handle. He asked a young boy with a mop of sandy hair where he could find the washroom; the boy looked at him in cheery surprise. "It's just over yonder, man." The words dribbled out slow and deliberate. Nigel wondered if the boy were laying the accent on so thick in a pastiche of how his own voice must sound, but the boy shone bright as a star, red vest layered over his black t-shirt and cuffed blue jeans.

He cut through the butcher's curtain into the stockroom, where pallets waited for the workers to come and unload them by forklift onto towering wrought metal shelves. There were scraps of rubbish on the floor around the bin, tossed in haste by the previous day's workers, who had spent the evening unloading boxes of canned vegetables, frozen meat, sacks of dry goods. After grabbing a piece of cardboard, Nigel locked himself inside the single-occupant room. The antiseptic scent of soap was still fresh. He removed his brown Wolverines and stood barefoot on the cardboard. There was a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap in the left side pocket of his backpack: essentials kept close at hand so that he wouldn't need to open the roll-top and pull out his inflatable mattress, his feather sleeping bag, his tent or change of clothes. He wet the rough fabric and scrubbed his face, neck, behind his ears; rinsed the rag, then started on his armpits and chest. The peppermint soap made the head of his penis tingle in the air conditioned room. After carefully washing his feet under the warm running water, he wet his hair and raked his fingers through it. As he brushed his teeth, he gave each of his socks a minute under the hand dryer. They went on last after the slim-cut navy pants, the loose brown merino knit. 

A toad-faced woman with frown-lines etched into her spray tan watched him wheel his cart to the door, heft his backpack onto his shoulders, and walk back into the morning.

Men filed through alley doors into the hot kitchens and backrooms where they would spend the day. They grumbled and coughed. Occasional laughter from a well-timed joke echoed off the bricks. Shopgirls and waitresses filed into glass-fronted stores, whereupon their manager would rack the deadbolt behind them. The Kid and the Mexican stood breathing fog onto the window of one such shop, staring with bulging eyes as a young woman pulled the shirt off a mannequin. The Kid's lips glistened as sharply-pointed plastic breasts came into view; his jaw dropped when the captive girl bent down to retrieve the machine-spun garment. She jerked the blouse into place, a grief-stricken frown stamped on her face.

With her task finished, she turned on the staring pair. Her eyes passed over the short brown-skinned one and settled on the tall white one---the one with drool in the corner of his mouth. A single tear spilled from her eye. *Fuck you!* she enunciated with undeniable clarity, muted by the layers of unbreakable polymers; and she retreated into the middle-distance of the shop, swallowed up in a cloud of consolant peers.

"Bro, I think I'm in love," the Kid said as though awoken from a dream. He wore a light wool vest over a leather jerkin, layered over a shirt unbuttoned to his diaphragm, his thin, hairless chest exposed to the world. He preferred huaraches, because they did not require socks: one less thing to worry about. His wrists and neck were festooned with cords and leather thongs hung with smooth stones and tied in the intricate patterns of macramé.

The Mexican held a ragged guitar case and wore the same cheap clothing that had adorned the mannequins last season. He found his clothes discarded outside donation bins, in plastic bags stuffed with cheap clothing so that they burst like ripe fruit when he prodded them. He had even found a guitar there. Both of them were filthy, but the Mexican replaced his clothing more frequently and hence remained less malodorous to the outside perspective.

Nigel came walking down the street, his minimalist kit strapped tightly to his back. His head was up and he looked around with intent, not much older than the two who stood in front of the window. The Kid knew this guy's type at a glance: a wanderer, a lost soul, always on the move and without a territory to call home.

"Good morning to you, dude," the Kid said as Nigel drew up. "How was your night?"

"I got in late," Nigel said. "Slept behind a dumpster. It was quiet, at least."

"You look clean, man," the Kid said. There was a tent roll strapped to the top of Nigel's backpack like the crossbar of a T. The Kid and his silent companion had no luggage other than the musician's burden.

"Early bird gets the bath."

The Kid did not waste energy fumbling with this quip. "We were about to go smoke a joint."

"Can I join you?" Nigel shifted his backpack. The morning was heating up.

The Kid and the Mexican exchanged a glance. The American could read the magnanimity in his friend's eyes. "Sure: got any money?"

"Let me check---hold on..." Nigel turned his back to them, but the Kid couldn't help seeing the brown leather wallet he pulled from his pocket. It wasn't the cash that held meaning for him---it was the cards sitting in their slots. Each one was a sign of a life still tethered to the straight world. He and the Mexican the rest of them had been cast out of Paradise, left with no choice but to make their home in the anarchy of the night. The Kid laid his stake in Pandemonium, but Nigel had only dipped his toe into this world.

Nigel turned and put a five dollar bill in the Kid's hand. "I'll give you this," he said.

"That'll do, man. You're welcome to join us in the VIP smoking lounge. Step this way, my dude." The three of them rounded the corner of the store where the shopgirls fluttered like butterflies in a cage. They entered the alley.

The Kid opened a toy Pokéball that hung around his neck, not bothering to hide its contents. It was stuffed with plastic bags, some of which contained even smaller baggies; but after a clumsy thumb through the packages, the Kid blinked his bleary eyes and recalled that that's not where he kept his smoking supplies: those were kept in a soft knit purse that hung around his torso. He took a rolling paper and filled it with a blend of orange tobacco and what looked like flakes of oregano. The mixture was dry as hay.

They passed the girthsome cigarette of fast-burning grass around. The tip they put to their lips became wet with mingled saliva. The Mexican coughed viciously and his eyes turned bright red. The Kid shrugged. His senses dulled, and hollow ache in his chest abated for the moment.

He picked up a piece of cardboard from the alley floor, along with a discarded coffee cup. "What's that for?" was the consequent chirp from Nigel. Like all tourists, he was interested in local customs. The Kid was not above the role of guide, but it demanded of his resolve to forgive a broken taboo. He could only manage to mutter under his breath, "what do you think?" and with his friend walk back out onto De La Guerra.

Their station was a concrete planter they could set their backs to. The Mexican took out his guitar, put the beaten box in the middle of the walkway, and began to pluck a solo on its loose strings. The Kid scrawled "please help" in a rough hand on his scrap of cardboard before he leapt face-first into the spray. The day was now in swing, a current of gaily-strolling shoppers thick and heavy. Parents pushed babies in strollers, escorted children who babbled with excitement to be out with their families. Sullen teenagers lurked in their wake, radiant and pale in the sun, fighting to break free from the grip of paternal law, to explore the boundaries of Heaven's grace. The Kid, who was also a teenager, did not dwell on the thin distance that cut him off from this world. All he knew was its proximity: they all stood in the same street: it was within arm's reach. He bobbed and weaved, and the Pokéball bounced against his chest. He put forth the plea of his sign with a pitch he had crafted over the course of long years: he did not beg on the verge of tears; neither was he overly effusive, which rang fake and which no-one could keep up for long hours. Instead, he approached his marks without embarrassment, an air of insouciance permitting him to get close without the appearance of a threat. He conveyed with nonchalance that he would deign to accept their change. Silver and copper coins fell in the stained cardboard cup he held out, in the guitar case that lay open on the pale red bricks. If a bank note was crumpled up and tossed their way, he would quickly pocket it before the still air could snatch it up.

Nigel hesitated, then sat next to the Mexican and leaned against the pebbled side of the planter. The Kid approached spanging with an active hand, but Nigel was not prepared to go that far. He took time drawing his sign: "Giving is the highest virtue," signed "Nietzsche." The Mexican struck a discordant note and met the Kid's eye.

"You can't sit next to us, dude. It's bad for business. Go down over there." The Kid pointed down the block, where there was another concrete planter. "We'll meet up later."

When the Kid approached him three hours later, he was yawning over a copy of *The World as Will \& Representation*.

"C'mon, man, it's quitting time," the Kid said. Two police officers followed them at a distance. "How'd you do?"

"Pathetic." Nigel counted the coins in his cooking pot. "\$2.63, barely half of what I gave you. How did you do?"

"We did alright," the Kid said, fist in his pocket clenched tightly around the bills. He and the Mexican pooled their money, but he held onto it.

"You're sitting there, face hidden in some book, ignoring everyone, and they're ignoring you back. This is work, man. Best get used to it. C'mon---let's go get a drink." Together, the three of them strutted down the sidewalk, proud rebels among all those who remained chained to the ordering principles of the ordered world. The cops followed for a block, then faded away. Nigel walked abreast but slightly apace from the pair, thumbs under the shoulder straps of his backpack.

A few blocks down, another group of tarnished angels stood in dark silhouette against the brightness of the day. One of them stood in the middle of the sidewalk, guitar around his neck, twanging the strings and bellowing a punk dirge. A thin, hunched one sat on the edge of the planter, wraparound sunglasses and a baseball cap to protect his pale face from the sun. The old-timer was stretched out comfortable and unselfconscious, red-striped pants against the bricks. A tattered bowler shaded his eyes.

"Hey, man? What's going on with y'all?" The Kid drawled as they drew up.

"Who's this guy?" the one with the guitar demanded, turning and stepping towards them. He was shorter than Nigel, who was shorter than the Kid, but his wide frame was accentuated by the shiny green bomber jacket he wore in the afternoon sun. His hair was growing back from a buzzcut; he had on tight jeans and big black boots.

"This is my new friend, man. He likes to smoke weed: he's a very cool guy."

"I don't like the way you look, cool guy. You're too clean. You're green. I can smell it."

"C'mon, man, let's be cool," the Kid said, getting in front of Nigel. He didn't look like the type to start a fight, but the Kid made a show of holding him back. If the Skinhead thought Nigel was the sort to stand up for himself, he would back down.

"What are y'all up to, anyway? Me and my friends here were about to get a drink."

"Yeah---fine; the heat's on, anyway."

Now they were seven strong: seven, like the number of divisions in the celestial vault and its Abyssinian reflection; seven, like the archangels who stand above the millions of Heaven's host; or like their seven fallen counterparts, each ruling his infernal principality. An envoy of chaos too powerful for the forces of law to let go unmolested. Without needing to confer, the seven broke formation and split into two groups staggered along the side-street. The Skinhead and the Kid lagged behind; Nigel saw the Kid open his Pokéball and touch the man's hand. The Mexican shook his head, and with knitted brows, pushed Nigel on.

Out front of the liquor store, the Kid filled Nigel's hand with warm coins and crumpled bills, then sent him to buy enough for the three of them. "Get as much as you can of whatever's cheapest." They darted across the off-ramp between waves of traffic, then continued down a short grade where two concrete blocks lay discarded in a patch of weeds and trash. They were in a blind spot, surrounded by the ceaseless wash of traffic, yet invisible to any passing car. The seven popped the lids from their bottles of beer. The Kid looked at his silent companion, and they drank a toast together. Whereas weed smoke numbed, the beer filled him with light effervescence---a warm buoyancy that he could float away on, up and up until he would no longer feel the vacuum sucking at the edges of his soul.

The Skinhead and the Mexican strummed their guitars. They were impossible to hear over the roar of traffic unless you sat directly next to them, which Nigel did not. Instead, the Kid sat with new friend and listened to the old-timer dressed like a carny. "I've been riding the rails since the '70s," the man said. Long grey hair hung in greasy strings around his hat. "I move around most of the year, until winter comes. Then I like to find somewhere out west, where it's warm. Santa Barbara's a good spot. Not as dangerous as LA. Plenty of rail lines coming in, too." His eyes were small in his brown, wrinkled face. The Kid had never ridden the rails---he was not interested in travel. Nigel told the man that he was coming from Los Angeles, headed north. "My sleeping pad is rated to negative thirty, my sleeping bag to negative fifteen. With an emergency blanket, one of those tinfoil ones, I've slept out in negative thirty. The worst thing about it is the condensation that you get inside the tent." The Kid heard these strange units of measurement, but did not waste energy parsing what they might mean. The old-timer's eyes glittered like a fish in the river Styx.

They rationed their tobacco by breaking apart cigarettes and rolling them into spliffs. It was late afternoon. The Kid sipped his beer patiently while the Skinhead held his by the neck, sucking from the bottle, inured to the strongest ABV. He felt a pain in his midsection and took a long pull from his drink.

"Where's the feed at? I'm starving." Nigel asked.

The Kid looked at him, eyes red and cheeks ruddy. "There's one down at the Salvation Army. We got a bit of time to kill. We can go together."

They took their fractious path back into town and passed a large clock-tower along the way. The bronze plaque at its base designated it an important landmark in the state's history. Nigel took out his iPod touch and snapped a photo. His use of electronics for the purpose of sight-seeing was not lost on the Skinhead, who glowered, drunken face sliding downwards until it threatened to slip from his skull. He stank of alcohol, cigarettes, the sweat caught up in the bomber that he never took off.

"You faggot. You're a rich kid, aren't you?"

Nigel ignored him and moved to catch up with the others.

"Watch yourself, bro," was all the Kid said. The Mexican looked at him with round eyes.

The Salvation Army was in a parish hall built in the typical American Protestant style. Rather than build a Gothic cathedral with soaring buttresses in glory of God, this building's rough-hewn timber, whitewashed walls, and red brick reflected the humble place of man. A modest architecture, but ultimately an architecture of self-centred resentment.

The line of men was already marching slowly into the building. Their squadron fell into ranks with the rest of the battalion, swaying, shepherded to a long table covered tight with a plastic drop-sheet. One by one, the tables were beckoned by a volunteer to stand, take their tray, and receive their bounty. Volunteers paced the aisles to make sure no-one started eating prematurely. When everyone had been served, Father asked them to bow their heads in prayer. These men would not join hands.

"Loving Father, grant your children humility and wisdom to know when they are weary and in need of rest, and may your Holy Spirit remind them that they can lean into you always for all things. In your presence, may they receive your forgiving grace for anything that is entangling or hindering them, lifting their eyes again to Jesus who offers life in abundant fullness.

"Replace discouragement with joy, weariness with fresh energy, weakness with renewed strength, and may your gift of patient endurance be poured out upon your children in ever increasing measure."

The Kid and the Mexican knew the prayer by heart. They clasped hands and moved their lips in pious observance, unashamed in the house of God. Nigel observed the gesture, but did not know the words. He raised his head and saw the Skinhead staring baleful daggers at him, hands flat on the table. His eyes were glazed; a line of spit descended perilously from his slack mouth.

"Amen," Father said. Angels are corporeal, too: they ate. Their metal trays had four sections: for the meat (fried ham), vegetable (canned green beans), salad (vinegar coleslaw), and dessert (a square of white cake). Nigel traded his ham to the Mexican, and received a second portion of vegetable. They were tepid, pale green, watery and tasted metallic from the tin can; but they still had bite, and after adding a liberal sprinkle of salt and pepper from the nearby shakers, the Kid found them perfectly toothsome. Sentries paced up and down the aisles, refilling their plastic cups with water.

The Kid ate with the same unhurried pace with which he spanged and drank, enjoying the chatter around the table as much as the nourishment. The Mexican ate hunched over his plate, looking around, on guard. Nigel shovelled the food into his mouth. None of them had eaten yet that day; their limbs needed nourishment to attain their full length. Together they picked up their squares of cake, and, grinning like brothers, bit into the soft white morsels. Vanilla sweetness shot up their palettes after the bland entrées. The Kid could not contain himself and ate his piece in two bites; Nigel and the Mexican savoured theirs. It took the Skinhead until the men had begun to return their trays and file out of the building to finish his meal, wheezing heavily and hatefully biting down on his fork. He dropped half his food over the table, onto the floor, barking curtly if a friend thought to address him, not taking his glazed eyes from Nigel.

***

When they exited the church into the pink dusk, Nigel stuck close to his companions. Their rebel band was grown more numerous and bold under cover of falling night. They headed to an ad hoc afterparty. The Skinhead straggled behind, guitar case strung around his back.

Nigel looked back just in time to see the Skinhead, bend over with hands on knees, and disgorge a wave of vomit. He was close enough to see the texture of the barely-digested food; he could see the tears standing out on his cheeks as his emaciated frame wrung itself empty. Bile and half-chewed green beans splashed on his heavy black boots, dribbled down the front of his bomber.

"I don't think he eats very often," the Kid observed. "He wanted to chill with us." His lip was curled with disgust while the Mexican laughed hysterically.

No-one stayed by the Skinhead's side as he collapsed on the lawn of some low-fronted government house. Nigel heard a distinct *crunch* as he fell onto his guitar. His face glowed pale and pitiful in the twilight; he curled into a fetal position and rolled under a bush. The group continued on, uncaring, leaving their fellow with nothing but callous laughter.

The world purpled. Together they found a place out of sight, where they could put their coins together and drink and forget about the knives each carried in his pocket. The anarchy of night fell over the earth, and like a swarm of bats they rose up to greet it. Nigel looked around him. He couldn't see the Kid, nor his silent sidekick; even the Skinhead's familiar growl was gone. He didn't know any of these people. He was not loyal to them.

Inhibitions loosened, shame dissipated along with the heat of the day. Out came the glass pipes and the blue flames. Acrid exhalations of crystal meth hit Nigel's nose. The old-timer's face no longer appeared benign, but was instead cragged in the eerie light of a distant streetlamp. Nigel realized he had revealed too much of himself. There were no kids here, just men: desperate souls hardened by their fall from favour.

They realized that he didn't belong there at the same moment he did.

"Well, I'll be going now," Nigel said to no-one, and he started walking out of the park. "Hey!" someone shouted after him. He kept walking and did not look back. He thought this street led north, so that's where he went. He walked back through the downtown where he had sat with his sign, happy to have made a place in the world, even if only for a short time. He walked by low, rambling homes with dried-out lawns, until the street turned into a major four-lane road. The sidewalk was broken and narrow, a chain-link fence and forested embankment to his left. Neither the path nor the distance in this part of the world was designed for pedestrians. He kept walking.

He paused to take his bearings. It was past nine o'clock: his only object now was to find somewhere to set up his tent and sleep for the night. The alcohol and heat of the day had left him drained. He could only keep going, since there was nothing behind him---except, as he glanced over his shoulder, he saw a figure a long distance off: a grey silhouette stopped on the edge of a pool of light, halogen bulbs suspended on concrete pillars tall as redwoods. There was nothing out here. Nigel kept walking. He looked behind him again. The figure kept pace. It was too dark and too far for him to make out any details: just a grey shape.

Nothing around him changed. There were no branchings, no side-streets, nothing aside from these four lanes where, ever few minutes, a single car would roar by at top speed. The fence cut off any avenue of escape. He glanced over his shoulder, and could not help but conclude that the figure was gaining on him.

The sidewalk came to the interstate, four lanes separated by a concrete meridian, trafficked by a near-constant stream of vehicles. Nigel waited, poised for his moment, then ran across the first two lanes to the meridian.

"That's it." He unslung his backpack and leaned it against the streetlight. He stood in the light. Dust from the hurtling vehicles stung his eyes.

The figure approached, standing back from where Nigel had crossed. He could make out red-striped pants like those worn in a circus. The round shape of a bowler. Bared teeth glistened; the whites of bulging eyes reflected the light. The old-timer watched and waited, still arms hanging limp, face frozen in a rictus. Nigel sat with back against the post. He put his head in his hands. When he looked up, the figure was gone.
