Santa Barbara is connected to the Los Angeles Metro Area by unbroken sprawl; one can travel that far by city bus, transferring from one distinct line to the next. Downtown is paved with glazed brick, smooth and glassy and red as terracotta [TK] faded pale by the Western sun. The bricks are laid following a pattern carefully engineered to eliminate visible irregularities; even the concrete joinery is laid by a machine, perfectly consistent, resulting in a surface as smooth and level as asphalt.

As the sun was breaking over the Pacific, Nigel walked along the damp-dew bricks of De La Guerra Street. He paused next to the discount clothing store and hitched the belt on his backpack, moving its weight onto his hips and off his tired shoulders. The street seemed to open up, so he kept walking, marvelling at the shape of the fire-hydrants, the curved porticos of the faux-Adobe [TK] architecture.

The ceaseless sound of traffic on the freeway washed over him like a wave. There appeared an ocean of concrete, painted with a grid of lines whose position was calculated to fit the maximum number of cars in the lot. The expanse was still empty, only peopled with three vehicles in the employee section. The grocery warehouse was open, bright lights piercing the early morning.

Nigel grabbed a cart and threw his backpack down onto the undercarriage, then leaned low over the handle as he looked for the bathroom. He asked a young boy with a mop of sandy hair, who looked at him in cheery surprise. "It's just over yonder, man." His accent dribbled out slow and relaxed, to where Nigel considered if it was a prank; but the boy shone so brightly, red vest layered over his black t-shirt and cuffed blue jeans.

He cut through the butcher's curtain into the stockroom, where pallets were unloaded by forklift onto towering wrought metal shelves. There were scraps of rubbish on the floor around the bin, tossed in haste by the night workers who had unloaded boxes of canned vegetables, frozen meat, and flour. After grabbing a piece of cardboard, Nigel locked himself inside the single-occupant room. The antiseptic scent of soap was still fresh at the beginning of the day. He removed his brown Wolverines and stood barefoot on the cardboard. There was a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap in the left side pocket of his backpack: essentials kept close at hand so that he wouldn't need to open the roll-top and pull out his inflatable mattress, his feather sleeping bag, his tent or change of clothes in search of whatever he needed. He wet the rough fabric and scrubbed his face, neck, behind his ears; rinsed the rag, then started on his armpits and chest. The peppermint soap made the head of his penis tingle in the air conditioned room. After carefully washing his feet under the running water, he wet his hair and racked his fingers through it. As he brushed his teeth, he gave each of his socks a minute under the hand dryer. They came on last after his slim-cut navy pants, the loose brown knit. 

As he was leaving the bathroom, a toad-faced woman with frown-lines etched into her spray tan watched him wheel his cart to the door, heft his backpack onto his shoulders, and walk back into the morning.

Men filed through alley doors into the kitchens and backrooms where they would spend their day working. Grumbling, a cough, occasional laughter from a well-timed joke echoed off the bricks. Shopgirls and waitresses filed into glass-fronted stores, whereupon their manager would rack the deadbolt behind them. The Kid and the Mexican stood breathing fog onto the window of one such shop, staring with bulging eyes as a young woman pulled the shirt off a mannequin. The Kid's lips glistened as the sharply-pointed plastic breasts came into view; his jaw dropped when his captive bent down to retrieve the machine-spun garment. She jerked the blouse into place, a grief-stricken frown stamped on her face.

With her task finished, she turned on the staring pair. Her eyes passed over the short brown-skinned one and settled on the tall white one---the one with drool in the crease of his mouth. A single tear spilled from her eye. *Fuck you!* she enunciated with undeniable clarity, muted by the layers of unbreakable polymers sandwiched between the glass; and she retreated into the middle-distance of the shop, swallowed up in a cloud of her consolant peers.

"Bro, I think I'm in love," the Kid said as though waking from a dream. He wore a light wool vest over a leather jerkin, layered over a shirt unbuttoned to his diaphragm revealing his hairless chest. His wrists and neck were festooned with cords and leather thongs, smooth stones and the intricate patterns of cotton macramé.

The Mexican held a ragged guitar case and wore the same cheap clothing that had adorned the mannequins last season. He found his clothes discarded outside donation bins in plastic bags that burst like ripe fruit; he had even found a guitar there. Both of them were filthy, but the Mexican replaced his clothing more frequently and hence his quality of his stink was different.

Nigel came walking down the street, unburdened by his minimalist kit; his head was up and he looked around intently. He was not much older than the two who stood in front of the window. The Kid knew this guy's type: a transient.

"Good morning to you, dude," the Kid said as Nigel drew up. "How was your night?"

"I got in late," Nigel said. "Slept behind a dumpster; it was quiet, at least."

"You look clean, man," the Kid said. There was a tent roll strapped to the top of Nigel's backpack like the crossbar of a T. The Kid and his silent companion had no luggage other than the musician's burden.

"Early bird gets the bath."

The Kid was drifting. "We were about to go smoke a joint."

"Can I join you?" Nigel shifted his backpack. The morning was heating up.

The Kid and the Mexican exchanged a glance. The American could read the magnanimity in his friend's eyes. "Sure: got any money?"

"I've got a bit of money---hold on..." Nigel turned his back to them, but the Kid couldn't help seeing the brown leather wallet he pulled from his pocket. It wasn't the cash that held meaning for him, but all the cards sitting in their slots. Each one was a sign of a life still tethered to the straight world. The rest of those street angels had been cast off, thrown out to drown and be reborn as something new, a creature suffused with utter chaos. Nigel was only stepping his foot into this world.

The Kid was a bum, a homeless person who stays within the same general locality. He had spent most of his life drifting around the greater Los Angeles area, but Santa Barbara had been his territory for some years. He could tell a tourist when he saw one, and welcomed them with the same genial hospitality he maintained for everyone.

Nigel turned and put a five dollar bill in the Kid's hand. "Take this," he said.

"I'll take it, man, and now you're welcome to join us in the executive smoking lounge. Just this way, my dude." The three of them rounded the corner of the store where the shopgirls fluttered like butterflies in a cage. They entered the alley.

The Kid opened a toy Pokéball that hung around his neck, not bothering to hide its contents. It was stuffed with plastic bags, some of which contained even smaller baggies; but after a clumsy thumb through the packages, the Kid blinked his bleary eyes and recalled that that's not where he kept his smoking supplies. Those were kept in a soft knit purse that hung around his torso. He took a rolling paper and filled it with a blend of orange tobacco and what looked like flakes of oregano. The mixture was dry as hay.

They passed the girthsome cigarette of fast-burning grass around. The tip they put to their lips became wet with mingled saliva. The Mexican coughed viciously and his eyes turned red. The Kid shrugged. As his senses dulled, so too did the aching hollow in his chest.

He picked up a piece of cardboard from the alley floor, along with a discarded coffee cup; and "what's that for?" was the consequent chirp from Nigel. Like all tourists, he was interested in local customs. The Kid was not above the role of guide, but it demanded of his resolve to forgive breaking taboo and asking about the unspoken customs of their trade. The Kid only muttered under his breath, "what do you think?" and with his friend walked back out onto De La Guerra.

They stationed themselves by some concrete planters they could set their backs to. The Mexican took out his guitar, put the beaten box in the middle of the walkway, and began to pluck a solo on its loose strings. The Kid scrawled "please help" in a rough hand on his scrap of cardboard, and jumped face-first into the spray. The day was now in swing, the current of gaily-strolling shoppers thick and heavy. Young couples walked hand-in-hand. Parents pushed babies in strollers, escorted children babbling with excitement to be out in the day. Teenagers lurked sullenly in the wake, radiant and pale in the sun, fighting to break free from the grip of law. The Kid, himself a teenager, did not think about the distance that cut him off from this world. All he knew was its proximity: this street lined with shops, and the people who filled it. He bobbed and weaved, the vigour of his movement bouncing the Pokéball against his chest. He put forth the plea of his sign with an expertly-crafted pitch: he did not beg on the verge of tears, as some did; neither was he overly effusive, which no-one could keep up for long hours. Instead he approached his marks without embarrassment, getting in their space without violating it, conveying with nonchalance that he would deign to accept their change. Silver and copper coins fell in the stained cardboard cup he held out, in the guitar case that lay open on the pale red bricks. If a bank note was crumpled up and tossed their way, they would quickly pocket it before the wind could steal it.

Nigel hesitated for a moment, then sat next to the Mexican, leaning against the pebbled side of the planter. The Kid approached spanging with an active hand, but Nigel was not prepared to go that far. He took time drawing his sign: "Giving is the highest virtue," signed Nietzsche. The Mexican stopped playing, met the Kid's eye.

"You can't sit right next to us, dude. Go down over there." The Kid pointed down the block, where there was another concrete planter. "We'll meet up later."

When Nigel realized that his new spot was downstream of most traffic, he became convinced that was the reason he received so few alms. After three hours, he had not recuperated half of what he had paid to get into the smoking lounge. The only thing he had to read was *The World as Will \& Representation*. He tried to focus on Schopenhauer's paragraphs, but not having read Kant or knowing anything about epistemology, he could not get a hold on the basic questions of the book.

"C'mon, man, it's quitting time," the Kid said. Two police officers followed them at a distance, squad car parked by the side of the road. "How'd you do?"

"Pathetic." Nigel counted the coins in his cooking pot. "\$2.63. Who's walking around with pennies in their pocket? How did you do?"

"We did alright," Tyler said, fist in his pocket clenched tightly around the bills. He and the Mexican pooled their money, but he would always hold onto it. He trusted his companion, but also knew his limits.

"C'mon---let's go get a drink." Together, the three of them strutted down the sidewalk, walking proudly among all those who remained chained to the ordering principle of institutional reality. Two cops followed from a distance, making sure they would cease their unlawful activity before fading away. Nigel walked abreast but slightly apace from the others, thumbs under the shoulder straps of his backpack.

A few blocks down, they came upon a second group of rebels. Nigel could identify them by the backpacks some of them carried; by how the old-timer, wearing red-striped pants like they did in the circus, stretched out comfortable and unselfconscious on the bricks.

"Hey, man? What's going on with y'all?" The Kid drawled as they drew up. Nigel caught a glimpse of the dynamic: the second group represented a social formation, whereas the Kid and his sidekick was the wildcard. He crossed between worlds, was known to socialize with delinquent youths looking for a taste of chaos---and for acting as a guide for tourists and greenhorns.

"Who's this guy?" the biggest of the group responded, turning and stepping forward. He was shorter than Nigel, but built wide and strong like a football player. His hair was growing back from a buzzcut; he had on big black boots, tight jeans, and wore a heavy green bomber jacket in the afternoon sun.

"This is my new friend, man. He likes to smoke weed and that makes him a very cool guy."

"I don't like the way you look, guy. You're too clean. You're green. I can smell it."

"C'mon, man, let's be cool," the Kid said, getting in front of Nigel. He didn't look like the type to initiate violence, but the Kid held him back nonetheless. If the Skinhead thought the tourist was the sort to stand up for himself, he might back down.

"What are y'all up to, anyway? Me and my friends here were about to get a drink."

"Yeah---we're going up to the highway."

Now they were seven strong, a force too powerful for this city. Without speaking, the drifters broke formation and split into two groups staggered down the side-street. The Skinhead and the young hippie fell behind; Nigel saw the Kid open his Pokéball and touch the man's hand. The Mexican gently pushed Nigel on.

Out front of the liquor store, the Kid filled Nigel's hand with warm coins and crumpled dollars to buy enough for the three of them. They sat on concrete blocks in a patch of weeds by the freeway, across the on-ramp and down a short grade. They were in a blind spot, surrounded by the ceaseless wash of cars, yet invisible to them. Seven, like the number of archangels, was too many for the police to ignore. The Kid looked at the Mexican, his friend, and they drank together. The drink filled him more than the smoke, and the Kid found that if he drank deep enough, it would fill him up until he entirely forget the hole sucking his soul inwards.

The Skinhead and the Mexican strummed on their guitars. It was impossible to hear them over the roar of traffic unless you sat directly next to them, which Nigel did not. Instead he talked to the old-timer that had been spread out careless on the sidewalk.

They all kept drinking, rationing their tobacco by breaking them apart and rolling them into spliffs. It was late afternoon. Nigel had to pace himself: he knew from experience that he could not keep up with the others. He sipped his beer. He was getting hungry.

"Any bum feeds around here?"

The Kid looked at him, eyes red and cheeks ruddy. "Yeah, down at St. Michael's [TK]. It's not 'til six, though. We got a few hours to kill. We can go together."

When the time came, the group of them walked back into town together. They passed a large clock-tower. Nigel took out his iPod touch and snapped a photo of it. His use of electronics for the purpose of sight-seeing was not lost on the Skinhead, who glowered, his face sliding so far downwards it looked as though it might never end. He stank from alcohol, cigarettes, and the sweat caught up in the bomber jacket that he never took off.

"You faggot. You're a rich kid, aren't you?"

Nigel ignored him and moved to catch up with the others. The Mexican looked at him, mouth hard and unmoving.

"Watch yourself, bro," was all the Kid said.

The church was a modern methodist built in the southwestern style: rough-hewn wooden timber, whitewashed walls, red clay brick. It could have been a house. It was no Gothic cathedral, but something befitting the American Protestant ethic.

The line of men was already filing into the building. Their group joined, swaying, were shepherded to one of the long tables, covered with a plastic tablecloth. One by one, the tables were beckoned by a volunteer to stand, take their plate and tray, and receive their bounty. Volunteers paced the aisles to make sure no-one started eating prematurely. When everyone had been served, Father asked them to bow their heads in prayer.

"Dear Lord, give us strength through your bounty that we are about to receive. Although they may sin in their day to day, these men are lost souls fighting for survival. This bounty will lend strength to their body: by our coming together under this roof, give them strength in their soul to resist temptation. Amen."

The Kid and the Mexican knew the prayer by heart. Both clasped their hands and moved their lips piously along with the words. There was no fear of judgement in the house of God. Nigel made the gesture, but did not know the words. He raised his head and saw Joe staring evilly at him, hands flat on the table. His eyes were glazed, mouth askew, a line of spit descending perilously from his slack mouth.

"Amen," Father said, and the bums began to eat. Their metal trays had four sections: for the meat (fried ham), vegetable (canned green beans), salad (vinegar coleslaw), and dessert (a square of frosted cake). Nigel traded his ham to the Mexican, but in place of the cake he wanted received instead a second portion of beans. They were tepid, pale green, swimming in water and acidic from the tin can; but they still had bite, and after adding a liberal sprinkle of salt and pepper from the shakers nearby, he found them perfectly toothsome. Volunteers drifted through the aisles, refilling plastic cups with water.

The Kid ate at a relaxed pace, enjoying the chatter around the table as much as the nourishment. The Mexican ate hunched over his plate, looking around with guarded eyes. Nigel shovelled the food into his mouth. None of them had eaten yet that day, and all needed the nutrition to grow. They each picked up their cake and bit into its soft white body, enjoying the vanilla sweetness after their bland entrees. The Kid could not contain himself and ate his piece in two bites; Nigel and the Mexican savoured theirs. It took the Skinhead until the men had begun to return their trays and file out of the building to finish his meal, hatefully biting down on his fork and breathing heavily. He dropped half his food over the table, onto the floor, barking short commands at those around him and not taking his glazed eyes off Nigel.

***

When they exited the church into the pink dusk, Nigel stuck close to his companions; they found themselves in a group grown even stronger than previous, heading to an unknown afterparty. The Skinhead straggled behind, carrying nothing but a guitar case.

Nigel looked back in time to see the Skinhead stop, bend over with hands on knees, and disgorge a wave of vomit from his mouth. He was close enough to see the texture of the barely-digested food, the tears standing out on his cheeks as his emaciated body was racked by spasms. It splashed on his heavy black boots and dribbled down the front of his bomber.

"I don't think he's used to eating," the Kid observed. "Normally he wouldn't, but he wanted to chill with us." His lip was curled with disgust while the Mexican looked on and laughed.

No-one stood by the Skinhead's side as he collapsed on the lawn of some anonymous public house. His face was green and pitiful in the twilight; he curled into a fetal position and rolled under a bush. They continued on.

They continued on in a world suffused with purple by the darkened sky. Nothing was as it seemed. Together they found a place out of sight where they could drink and have their last gasp at merriment. The sun sank below the horizon line: night came on, and like bats, at home in their element, were unafraid of being seen. Nigel looked around him. He couldn't see the Kid anymore, nor his silent sidekick. The Skinhead's familiar growl and baleful stare was also gone.

Inhibitions loosened by drink and deepening shadows, the pipes and blue flames were released. Acrid exhalations of crystal meth hit Nigel's nose. The only familiar face was the old-timer Nigel had spoken to by the bridge, in the light of day. Now his face was cragged in the eerie light of a distant streetlamp, and Nigel realized he had revealed too much of himself. The rebel angels became demons. There were no kids here, no greenhorns: just men, every last one of them desperate, hardened souls given up to the vices they used to survive.

They were realizing that he didn't belong there at the same moment as Nigel.

"Well, I'll be going now," Nigel said to no-one, and without looking back he started walking out of the park. "Hey!" someone shouted after him. He kept walking without turning around. He thought this street led North, the general direction he was travelling, so that's where he walked. He walked for an hour: back through the downtown where he had sat with his sign, just wanting to hang out---to live this life. He walked by low, rambling homes with dried-out lawns, until the street turned into a major four-lane road. The sidewalk was broken and narrow, a chain-link fence and forested embankment to his left. Nothing here was designed for pedestrians, neither path nor distance. He kept walking.

He paused to take his bearings. It was past 9pm: his only object now was to find somewhere to set up his tent and sleep for the night. The alcohol and heat of the day had drained him. He would need to keep going since there was nothing behind him---except, as he glanced over his shoulder, he saw a figure a long distance off: a grey silhouette stopped on the edge of a pool of light, cast by halogen bulbs suspended on concrete pillars tall as redwoods. There was nothing out here. Nigel kept walking. After several minutes, he looked behind him. The figure was keeping pace. It was too dark and too far for him to make out any details: just a grey shape of a man.

Nothing around him changed. There were no branchings, no side-streets, just these four lanes with traffic going by at top speed every few minutes. The chain link closed on him, cutting off any avenue of escape. He glanced over his shoulder. He saw now that the shape was misshapen: it could only be a man carrying a large backpack.

The road came to the interstate, four perpendicular lanes separated by a concrete meridian, trafficked by a near-constant stream of rushing cars. Nigel waited, poised for his moment, before running across the two lanes to the meridian.

"This is it," Nigel thought to himself. He unslung his backpack and leaned it against the streetlight. He stood directly in the pool of light, vehicles hurtling past on either side.

The figure approached, standing back from the where Nigel had crossed. He could make out the red-striped pants of the old-timer. His bared teeth glistened in the dark; his eyes bulged, whites reflecting the light. The man watched and waited, face frozen in a rictus. Nigel sat with back against the post. He put his head in his hands. When he looked up, the figure was gone.
