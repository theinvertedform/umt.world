The white line dividing the road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"We need to stop soon," Nigel said.

"I'm fine to keep driving for a while." Alisha didn't take her eyes from the road.

"But---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"I had one glass, and that was hours ago. Don't you trust me?"

"I do trust you---"

"My dad was a race car driver. He taught me how to roll. You don't have to worry."

"Let's go in there," he said, indicating the sign that cut off the semi-rural road.

"There? It's a school."

"Trust me."

She turned the wheel and brought them through a low gate. It was a low building lit with a single spotlight; the oversized lot was built to host game day traffic to the adjoining sports complex.

"Are you sure?" In the headlights, they could see the aluminum outline of a pitch, the patch of forest darkness beyond.

"Tomorrow's Saturday, and we'll be gone early. We can take cover under those trees."

They rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers to where the terrain came to an end. She turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" The two seats of the SUV were folded down to create a flat bed piled high with pillows and blankets. She clambered into the back while he opened and shut the door.

"Are you still hungry, dear? Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly."

"No shoes in bed." He kicked off his leather sneakers, then he unlaced her canvas trainers and set them in the driver's seat. She watched him in awe. The bulb above the rearview mirror switched off, leaving the interior of the vehicle cast in the elusive illumination from the distant spotlight.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We've got a cucumber, some cheese. I'll make us sandwiches. On the farm, we ate a lot of goat cheese. We had lots of cucumbers, too, always pickled. A pickle or some sauerkraut every day for almost an entire month. Then I had another pickle when I got to Berlin. It wasn't as good, but it was just from a stall at 4am."

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, along with two blue napkins that they used as plates.

"What were you doing out at 4am?"

"Partying. You've been to Berlin. You know how it is."

She drew the blade through the vegetable's dark skin, stopped it against her thumb. After assembling the ingredients, she handed him his portion.

"It was reckless to go out for dinner without somewhere to go afterwards." A piece of cucumber fell onto his napkin.

"But we were apart for two months. I missed you. I wanted candlelight and wine."

"It was worth it."

***

The morning sun glowed somewhere behind a canopy of white fog. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, ignoring the beige SUV with the windows steamed out. The clock on the dash read just before seven.

"It's time to get up," he mumbled, pulling himself from the warmth they had breathed into their cocoon.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream," she said, blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep.

"I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around and help me take care of the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing."

His hand was on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him. "Can we get a goat?"

They stood by the flanks of the SUV in the wet grass and bent the stiffness from their limbs. Nigel took out a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castile soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet the square of fabric with a splash of water from their bottle, apply a few drops of soap and scrub his face.

"We wash our face in the morning to show respect for the world we are about to encounter."

"Oh," she said. "Like how we do it to please God." She began to wash the sleep from her own eyes.

He thought for a moment. "You're right. It's an ablution."

***

The engine block turned slowly, warming in its groove. His notebook had a page with a list of dates and locations.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's a bit over three hours from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time."

Alisha looked at him, eyes half-lidded. She was watching his mouth with a coy expression.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing. He took hold of her, and she yielded with a sigh.

***

The *Leif Ericson* could hold many times more than the dozen cars that waited in queue. Two tractor-trailers were parked in a separate lane, each pulling a double load of linked shipping containers. A man in an orange safety vest waved them to their spot.

Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side. Down its side ran a single welded seam. She gave the top a loose fold, clasped the buckle before swinging it onto her back. Her hair was pinned down in the mock neck of her yak wool sweater. She put on her sunglasses and gave him a smile.

"I am locking the car doors," she announced with solemn deliberation. The SUV honked when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. When she pulled her hand back out, he took it, breathed onto her white fingers.

Vibrations from the engine came through the soles of Nigel's shoes. They churned the sea to a huge expanse of white froth in their wake. The peninsula disappeared in a round wall of fog. Beams broke through the cloud bank.

"We're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?"

A south wind buoyed them, blowing cold fresh life across the deck. Alisha turned away from the water, brought her arms together for him to shield her.

***

Along the perimeter of the common deck, empty blue vinyl seats were bolted in winged banks. Alisha looked out the porthole to the east. A crepuscular ray dappled her eye, a moment of illumination that Nigel saw pass over her in a flash before it fell upon him. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale." With the sun in his eye, she was just a silhouette whose edges sparkled.

"I held my breath the whole time you were away," he told her. She did not look away from the window.

"Oh," she said after a moment.

"Even after everything that happened before you left, I never stopped believing in us. It wasn't that big of a deal."

"It was a big deal to me. I tried to tell you. Things were out of control. You wouldn't listen."

She kept looking out the window while he slumped beside her.

"Maybe you shouldn't have waited." She turned her head to look at him. "That's why I went on that trip alone. I wanted both of us to take time. I wanted both of us to be sure."

"I am sure. Even if it seems impossible, I believe. That's what commitment is."

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to put his arm around her.

"I thought about you every minute," she said, looking up at him.

***

They moved along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door lay identical, pristine, empty cabins. They found one hatch unlocked, slid the deadbolt into place behind them, and deposited their bags by the bed. When he turned the faucet, hot water sprayed from the shower head. "The water works."

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two of them cradled in her arms, big and white and fluffy. "Let's take a shower!"

He glanced through the door of the bathroom towards the hatch that connected to the corridor. She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell.

"Don't worry, babe, it's locked!" She jumped into the tub, peeked around the edge of the shower's plastic shell. "It's warm in here." When she peered at him half-hidden, he couldn't help himself. He bared his teeth, growled, and tore himself naked.

***

"We're in it now," he said when they disembarked. Winter was behind them; the days lengthened, but this one had already descended into evening. They were in unfamiliar terrain without a plan.

"Are you scared?"

"There's not much light left. We don't know where we're going."

"Let's build a fire!" The thought had not occurred to him. She made her home in the world: he merely lived in it. They took the highway heading north. On their second night, they parked in the hollow of a beach and built a fire.

The road swept in undulating curves around the perimeter of ancient cliffs, low stone hills waving with wet yellow grass. Looking west they saw nothing in the direction of the mainland. Now they were four days on the road. When they stopped for supplies, they marvelled at the price of the wilted vegetables that came from double-linked shipping containers. They drank ambrosia, ate bread and fats.

***

Nigel opened his backpack, checked his laptop. The battery was low. "I'm down to the wire. I just need a few hours."

"Don't worry, babe. I'll find you a spot." She put her hand in his. "I promise."

The sun already hung mid-afternoon when they found themselves trawling a dozen thin buildings joined by unpainted roads, searching in vain for somewhere they could post up. Three hours down, the next village would be the same, and by then it would be dark. It wasn't until they had given up and were proceeding on their way that they found a low, white building, its windows boarded up with whitewashed plywood. Red neon glowed *open* above the white-handled door. The river spread fat down the hill out back.

"It's open!" she said.

***

Nigel's contracted pupils caught a brief outline of scattered chairs in the shaft of light that issued from the open door. When it swung shut behind them, their dilating perception drifted through the dim room to the bar.

"Who's there? I mean---hello," a man said, and stood up from his stool. The length of the bar was covered with papers, tools, assorted scrap.

"Are you open?" Alisha asked, stepping forward.

"Open! Of course I'm open!" Despite his affronted posture, Nigel recognized the rasp of a voice unused to talking.

"My name's Ray. Don't get too many visitors around here. What's your name? What can I get for you?"

"I'm Alisha. This is Nigel. He needs to use the internet and do some computer work. It'll only take a few hours. Do you have wireless internet here?"

"Do I---?" He paused in his efforts to sweep together papers and what looked like a disassembled motor. He stared at her. "Do I have---? Of course I do!"

Behind the plywood bar hung a shelf that held a half-dozen glasses and a bottle of Jameson. Ray disappeared through a door and returned immediately, hands filled with still more papers. He was heavier than Nigel, powerfully built and taller than them both. His grey hair was gathered in a ponytail and his skin was pockmarked. He moved with vigour, unrestrained by the paunch that had slipped into the second half of his life.

Nigel sat at the far end of the line of stools, his back to the view. He took out his laptop and plugged it into an extension cord that lay thick and orange across the floor.

"Now what can I get you? You're on a drive?" Ray looked from Nigel to Alisha. His concern softened his intimidating stature. "Not a drive, I mean a---whaddyacallem, road trip?"

"I just need to make sure that I can get online."

"Oh---" His attention returned to the sheaf in his hand. He produced a small paper calendar, pictures of cats and dogs for each month. In September two years back, he had written a string of characters that Nigel entered into his terminal.

"Okay," he said to Alisha, who was draped over his shoulders. She watched the screen with fascination. He showed her a document with comments in the margins. "I just need to go through my editor's comments, fix all the issues, then send it back."

"What does that one say?"

"That one says 'faith' needs a gloss. A few words to explain what it means."

"Faith? I thought it was a review of a book about communism."

"It's the main question of human existence. Communists think they're above it because Marxism is scientific, but when it comes to the pragmatic reality of organizing, existential questions become relevant again."

"What can I get you?" Ray was not about to leave them alone.

"We'll take two beers." Alisha said. After he took two bottles of ale from the mini-fridge and set them next to a large monkey-wrench, she detached herself from Nigel and went down to the corner where he had been seated upon their arrival.

"Where are you headed?" Alisha tried to focus his attention, even as he wanted to address both of them.

She was perched on her stool with her back arched. Ray stood behind the bar. Nigel glanced back at his screen. She crossed one leg over the other and didn't look at him. Her foot pointed coquettishly. She flipped her hair. Nigel took a pull from his bottle.

"The north ferry?" Ray was surprised. "It's dangerous up there. Cold. Better have extra batteries for your radio. What---no radio? You don't even have a proper spare?" He seemed worried.

> *For Kierkegaard, faith is the central question of religion, and therefore also the central question of human existence. God is an infinite being, yet He comes into being within a finite world. In logical terms, this is impossible; religion is based on a technical absurdity. Rational arguments for the existence of God miss the point: anyone who claims to "believe" is suspect. The point of human existence is to reconcile oneself with the impossible.*

"I was born out on that island," Ray said. Sliding glass doors opened onto a shaded patch of flat grass. The only light in the room came dim through this door. Nigel could see the first in a series of steps cut into the steep declension that led down to the forested riverbank. The water swept up blue and peach gold, framed by the doors. The thin line of the far shore cut the river from the sky. A narrow brown smudge coloured the pastel water.

"There are houses out there?" Nigel asked.

"Houses? Yes, about...five houses! The one I was born in is still standing. Last one. The rest are ruined. They're all dead. Just me and mum left."

Nigel closed the last of the document's comment and added another set of the initials "NC" to the sequence at the end of the filename. He sent it to his editor with a single short sentence in the body of the email.

"It's getting late," he said, standing next to Alisha. "Now that I have a charge, we could watch a movie."

"Okay!" she said, happy.

"Go down there," Ray said. He pointed to where the road led down towards the river. Nigel took a toke from the joint he had lit. "There's a big plateau. No-one goes down there. I grew this myself. Let me show you."

"We couldn't," Nigel insisted. He was tired of the interruption and wanted to be alone with her again.

***

She stopped the car in the middle of a wide empty field. The sky was enormous overhead, just beginning to darken. He put on *Casablanca* while she pushed the cushions into a headboard they could lean against. They ate Ryvita and yellow cheese while the sky sank into the river.

The weed had made him shy. He brushed his fingertips along the outline of her ribs, and although it made her laugh, he remained solemn. They lay on their sides, laptop forgotten. His shyness left him as he pressed his body into her. The sun would not set. Long grasses blew in an invisible wind. They pushed outwards against the inside of the SUV, against the roof, against the windows; pushed down into the cushions of their bed.

***

The earth itself is unfixed. Tectonic plates drift through the ocean, buoyed along by invisible currents. It's inevitable that one plate will come up against another. Over millions of years, the earth's understanding of what it must do grows, and force builds slowly into a collision. The globe is shrouded in tempest and strife. Storm clouds last eons. Plant species die out, animals teach their young to hide: but there is nowhere to hide from the lightning strikes, from the earthquakes and erupting volcanoes. By the end of this unstable era, when the quaking has subsided and the sun shines through again, the mantle of one land mass comes out on top of the other. Through arcane processes beyond the ken of man, the point of the spiral points to one peripheral zone of obduction: a distant island, there to throw up barren highlands and mournful mountain ranges of desolate pale-orange rock. A substance whose texture is unseen anywhere else on the surface of the earth. A substance so rich in iron that the only life that can propagate are certain purple-green plants that look like a mutated species of a seed dredged up from the ocean floor. They emerge from the crevice of stones split by their roots.

"The left pedal is for the brake, the right pedal is for the gas. This is your turning signal: use it every time you change lanes. That's the cruise control. Don't go over 90."

The stretches of highway were so long, the curves gentle and the traffic so sparse that he quickly grew confident behind the wheel. She would let him spend an hour or more driving while she reclined and consulted the map.

"We're coming up on the exit for the terminal. Slow down." They were on a straight stretch, no cars in either direction. The exit was on their left, a right angle through the grass meridian that split the highway in two directions. He pressed the brake.

"Slow down." They were up on the exit; he needed to turn the wheel. "Slow down!" The beige SUV drifted around the corner. He heard a distant screeching. He let the car level out before he pumped the brakes. They came to a stop halfway in the ditch.

"You almost killed us!"

"What do you mean? We're fine."

"If this was a car, we would have rolled! Didn't you hear me say slow down?"

"I did slow down." He was calm: she was over-reacting.

"Get out!" He closed the door quietly while she slammed hers. The vehicle was tilted at an angle, only one of its tires touching concrete. She was panting, and he was surprised to see tears standing out on her cheeks.

"Look at that!" She gesticulated at the road behind them. He saw four long black streaks burned into the pavement. "You were skidding! Don't you know how dangerous that is?"

"It was an accident."

She was examining the car now. "Look at this!" She pointed at the rear passenger-side wheel. "We lost a hubcap, Nigel!"

"I see it, it's just down there." He trotted down the road. Silence rang in his ears. The ferry terminal stood out low against the grey sea. It was scheduled to depart an hour from now. When he returned with the metal disc in hand, she was squatted by the SUV's driver's-side flank, her back leaning against it. She was crying now.

"I got the hubcap back. There's no damage we can't fix."

"That's not the point, Nigel. I tried to stop it, but you didn't listen. I told you, and you just wouldn't listen."

"I thought we were under control. Everything was fine."

"You weren't in control. We're in the ditch now."

***

Returning to the mainland did not take a full two hours. The *Qajaq W.* had no cabins, just an observation deck with a few vending machines. There was only one other passenger vehicle, a black pickup truck with humongous tires. Icebergs floated by. He thought about how cold the water must be.

They disembarked in a coastal depression. Up above them rose the dark outline of an impenetrable forest; further up swam unearthly colours in a new sky they had never seen before.

"We're in it now," Alisha said.

Beneath the price of gas at the village station read a discrete warning: "next stop 500KM." The station was closed.

"Over half a tank---can we make it?" Nigel asked from the passenger seat.

"We could make it. Maybe, barely. Is it worth it? I'm not sure."

"Slow and steady." He put his hand on her shoulder, squeezed, put his hand on the back of her neck. "That's how we'll get through this." She looked at him; her brows uncreased, the line of her mouth pointed up in a bow.

***

She drove at first to get the lay of the land. It didn't take long to become apparent: just a straight gravel road that continued on through uncultivated forest. Nigel was surprised to find that the landscape here threatened to overwhelm him. The bare rock hills, the hardy trees in all their variety held a deep terror for him. This place was lonely and cruel. His ablutions were vain. She wanted to make a fire, to find a bower and line it with flowers; he felt the unhomeliness of the world pressing against the thin membrane that separated them from the night.

"Keep it at 60. These stones could puncture a tire easily. They could do worse than that. If we get a flat, the donut won't get us far. It could be a day, maybe longer, before someone passes us. Ray was right: we should have a radio. We should at least have a spare."

***

They were in an endless aisle of aspens, wild bushes growing at the top of long trunks. The sun filtered through at the same low angle where it hovered without moving all day long. They had pulled over to the side of the road, barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass. The black pickup with whom they had disembarked stopped to see if they were okay. There was no-one else out there, and therefore all stopped to help each other. Nigel gave them a thumbs-up and a wave from the backseat. She trembled beneath him, soft pants around her knees. All he could see of her face was a single red cheek framed by her dark hair, the other half pressed into the pillow. He watched a bead stand still for a moment before running down, couldn't tell if it was sweat or a tear. She cried out.

***

"What's that!" They had come up on the crest of a clearing in the forest. Nigel pumped the brakes, but they had already made their interruption. A hawk flew off over the trees. A fox ran into the forest, and a rabbit bounded in the other direction. The caribou came up to them, indignant and stern. He trotted next to the SUV while the two sat frozen inside. They inched forward, Nigel's foot light to the pedal. They held their breath. He cantered around to the passenger side to examine Alisha more closely with his brown eye. Nigel saw that although the spirit huffed, he was not angry. He was only checking them out, and would allow them to continue on their way while he returned to the forest.

***

They were descending from the zenith of their voyage. The roads worsened the further south they moved, brought them high up in the mountains. The only traffic on the road were construction vehicles, huge tractors or pickup trucks or other SUVs covered in grime. The dirt road went up and down and wound around hairpin bends. Nigel felt out of his element behind the wheel, with an unprotected drop on one side and cement trucks constantly roaring past on the other. He gripped the wheel tight but didn't wake Alisha. As he came around one bend, he had to turn the wheel quickly to give a semi-truck pulling a load of timber logs enough space to pass without crushing them. His heart skipped a beat.

She woke as they were cresting, lay back in her seat for a moment, blinking, before she raised herself to look out at the forested valley to her right. Dark green and pale yellow.

"Wait---what *is* that?" she asked.

"I have no idea. I've been watching it get closer for hours now."

"It must be absolutely humongous. I had no idea there was anything like that out here."

"It's a sign," he said. "It's a sign to keep building."

***

They were now distinctly in a hurry. It was a bright morning, sun hot, the air warm again in the lowlands.

"We have to go for a swim," she insisted. "We have to jump in the river. I'm not ready."

"Don't worry. It's not over yet. We'll find somewhere." He took her hand. "I promise."

The dirt road had become a four-lane highway. They had unmistakeably returned to the straight world. She drove down a long access road until they saw somewhere to stop. The water was clear blue, down a short embankment to a beach of jagged rocks. They stripped down to their underwear and clambered down barefoot. They gasped and sputtered in the ice-cold river.

"There's something I need to tell you," she said.

"I know. I knew you would, when you were ready. Nothing you say can shake my commitment. I'll never stop believing. Even if it's impossible."

He was standing up to his ankles in the river, water streaming off his body. She sat on a stone and looked up at him, squinting. The sun was in her eye: he was just a sparkling silhouette.

"I feel young," he said.

"You are young."

"We're young," he said.
