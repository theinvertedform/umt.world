* Camping by the sports centre
* Driving by the beach to the ferry
* Exploring the ferry (it's empty)
* Camping by the side of the road; nothing around; fucking; slow \& steady wins the race
* Pausing at the bar to send edits. Old-timer talks about his weed, the island out in the river that he was born on.
* Camping out in a wide field; *Casablanca*, Ryvita, cheese; fucking so vigorously the SUV moves
* Animal conference around the bend; a caribou trots next to the car
* Gros Morne, like the surface of Mars. Walking through an empty information centre, reading the information displays. Eating lobster, but it's small, still young: they're there too early.
* Ice bergs off the northern coast; the power dam, its Sovietesque mass; unpaved roads like in South America
* Final scene: swimming in the freezing river before returning to the city, to work, to life. "I feel young."

He is a writer, unsure if he loves her. She is a musician, uses the camera he gave her, and cheated on him a few months ago.

The white line dividing the two-lane road glowed in the light of the SUV's high-beams.

"I don't want to go too much further," he said.

"Why not?" her eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"Nigel, I had one glass of beer three hours ago."

"But look, we don't have to go further anyway. Take the next right here."

She turned the wheel, and they passed through the gates into an empty parking lot. They were on the grounds of a school, with an adjoining sporting complex big enough to serve the entire region.

"Are you sure?"

"Why not---it's Saturday tomorrow. We'll be gone early. Just pull over there, by those trees. It'll give us a bit of cover."

She turned the wheel again, and they rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers lining the soccer pitch to a copse of trees that marked the edge of the terrain.

"Does it seem level here? It's important that we sleep on level ground, otherwise the blood will pool and our hearts might rupture."

"Our hearts! I think we'll be okay. We'll be gone early, after all," she said, and turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped out into the damp chill, then re-entered the vehicle through the back doors. The two seats were folded down to create a flat surface piled high with pillows and blankets. Their bags were stowed in the foot-well, pressed up against the front seats. She clambered over the backseat and met him there.

"Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly out there."

"Okay, okay, but no shoes in bed." He sat awkwardly, legs elevated, and kicked off his leather sneakers. She untied her canvas trainers and did the same. The light from the front seat turned off automatically, but the light from the school was bright enough to illuminate the interior of the car.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We don't have much. A cucumber, some cheese, some bread and hummus. Sandwiches!"

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, a spoon to spread the hummus, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. There was nothing she could use as a cutting board, so she drew the knife through the dark green skin and pale white flesh, stopping the blade against her thumb.

"Here you are, m'lord," she said, handing him his sandwich. He had never tasted anything like it.

It was a foggy morning. The sun shone wet into their pile of blankets. Nigel lifted his head. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, studiously ignoring the large, beige SUV parked under the trees. It was just before seven.

"Alisha, I think it's time to get up," he mumbled, wiping his eyes.

She stretched, yawned, popped her joints before sitting up. She wore her brown yak wool sweater; he was wearing his black pullover hoodie; their limbs were sore from the makeshift bed, from long hours sitting behind the wheel; they stretched in the fog, and their young bodies were quickly restored.

Nigel took out a small green canvas satchel from the footwell where he was keeping his toiletries. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet a small washcloth with a splash of water from their bottle and scrubbed his face.

"It's important to wash the face when you're in hobo-mode," he said. "An unwashed face that's just woken up is very obvious. People can always tell. Washing your face goes a long way towards disguising your appearance."

"Oh," she said, "they must think I'm normal," and proceeded to scrub the sleep from her eyes with her own washcloth.

She resumed her place behind the wheel, she in the passenger seat. While they waited a moment for the engine to warm, he took out his notebook and a map.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's just over three hours, approximately, from Truro to North Sydney. That gives us some leeway, but not too much. Let's make a quick stop at the first cafe, but there's a beach here, about halfway. Let's take a break there."

He looked at her; she looked back at him, evidently not paying attention to anything he had said.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He had been enunciating it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable in order to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's just too much---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When he kissed her, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing him aggressively; but when he gripped her, she yielded with a sigh and the seal broke.

She drove them along the foggy winding two-lane road, traffic flowing in both directions. Occasionally the forest of pines would break and they could see through to the sea, but it wasn't until they stopped at the beach that they got to taste the salt-spray air. Everything was grey, but they could see the wooden houses on stilts, brightly painted and shining in the cloudbank that submerged them. Smooth stones covered in moss, tangled netting and lobster traps. They continued on their way until they reached the ferry and joined the line of cars waiting to embark. The ferry was massive---as big as the *Titanic*, but they were only a dozen cars.

"How long is it, anyway?" he asked. He had neglected this piece of information.

"I think it's like seven hours," she said.

"Seven hours! We might as well set sail for the continent, then!"
