The white line dividing the two-lane road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"We shouldn't go much further," he said.

"Why not?" Her eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"Nigel, I had one glass of beer, three hours ago."

"But look, we don't have to go further anyway. Take the next right here."

She turned the wheel and brought them through a low gate, into the empty parking lot of a public school. It was a low building with a huge lot that could host a game day's traffic to the adjoining sports complex.

"Are you sure?"

"Tomorrow's Saturday, and we'll be gone early. Just pull over there, by those trees. It'll give us a bit of cover."

She turned the wheel again, and they rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers lining the soccer pitch to to where the darkness of a forest at night marked the edge of the terrain.

"Does it seem level here? We have sleep on level ground, Alisha, otherwise the blood will pool and our hearts might rupture."

"No! But I think we'll be okay. We'll be gone early, after all," she said, and turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped into the damp night, then re-entered the vehicle through the back doors. The two seats were folded down to create a flat bed piled high with pillows and blankets. Under the foot-well they kept their bags, pressed up against the front seats. She clambered into the back and met him there.

"Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly."

"Okay, okay, but no shoes in bed." He sat awkwardly, legs elevated, and kicked off his leather sneakers. She unlaced her canvas trainers and did the same. The light above the rear-view mirror turned off automatically, but the light from the school was bright enough to illuminate the interior of the car.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We don't have much. A cucumber, some cheese, some bread and hummus. I'll make us sandwiches."

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, a spoon to spread the hummus, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. The knife cut through the dark green skin, the pale white flesh; she stopped the blade against her thumb.

"Here you are, sir," she said, handing him his portion.

"*Merci*, lady." A slice of cucumber fell onto his napkin as he bit into the bread. The fatty texture of the hummus combined with the cheese into an opulent texture, sparked with the watery acid of the cucumber. Both remarked that they had never tasted something so delicious.

The morning sun glowed somewhere behind a fog it was unable to pierce. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, ignoring or not seeing the beige SUV parked under the trees wit the steamed-out windows. The analogue clock on the dash read just before seven.

"I think it's time to get up," Nigel mumbled, pulling himself from the warmth they had breathed under the cocoon of blankets.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream," she said, blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep. "I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around. He helped me with the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing." He sat beside her, hand on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him through long lashes. "Can we get a goat?"

They put on their shoes and stood along the flanks of the SUV. Her hair was held down under the mock neck of her yak-wool sweater. The hood of his black pullover sweatshirt was up, pushed back to frame his face and pin his hair in place. Together they saluted the sun, hands in the wet grass, and their young bodies were restored.

Nigel took out a small green canvas satchel from the footwell where he kept a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet a small washcloth with a splash of water from their bottle, apply a few drops of soap and scrub his face.

"We must always be careful to keep our faces clean while we're in hobo-mode," he said. "An unwashed face is very noticeable. They will always be able to tell us apart."

"Oh," she said. "I wouldn't want these strangers to think less of me, because my face isn't clean." She proceeded to wash the sleep from her eyes with her own washcloth.

They resumed their places with her behind the wheel and he in the passenger seat. While they waited for the engine to warm, he took out his notebook and a roadmap.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's just over three hours, approximately, from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time to stop at a cafe for our morning toilet, then take a break halfway."

He looked at her; she looked back, but not in the eye. She watched his mouth move. There was a coy expression on her face.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing: it fired him. He took hold of her and she yielded with a sigh.

Both lanes of the winding, two-lane road were filled with steady traffic. On occasion, the forest of pines would break; the fog would roll aside and they could see through the low hills to the sea. At the beach, they got their first taste of salt-spray air. Visibility was low, but streaks of bright paint on the wooden houses stood out in the thick atmosphere. No-one lived in these stilted shanties. When he looked more closely, Nigel saw that the paint peeled from the thin wooden planks under the constant onslaught of wind and moisture. The underside of the houses were hung with tangled netting and rickety traps, strings of buoys to mark the tide.

***

They were early to embark. She turned the engine off, and they stood out in the patch of grass. The *Leif Ericson* was a massive vessel, complete overkill for the dozen cars waiting in queue. Two tractor-trailers waited in a separate lane, each one pulling a double load of linked shipping containers.

When the time came, a man in an orange safety vest brought them to their parking spot, clustered together with the other passengers in the half-empty loading bay. Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side. A single welded seam ran down the middle. She gave the top a loose fold and clicked the buckle closed.

"I am locking the car doors," she announced with solemn deliberation. The SUV beeped when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. When she removed the hand out of her pocket, he took it, kissed it, breathed onto her white fingers.

From the open back of the loading bay, they could see the sea churned to white froth in their wake. The engine's vibrations came through the thick metal deck, through the soles of Nigel's shoes. The peninsula disappeared in the round wall of fog behind them. Nigel looked down its length to where a boy and a girl stood with their grave parents behind them. Together they watched the land recede. A ray of afternoon sun broke through the cloudbank.

"I think we're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?" She turned away from the sea, brought her arms together for him to shield her against the wind.

There were several different restaurants on the dining deck, but they were all closed save the generic, nameless cafeteria operated by the ferry company. They sold bread wrapped in plastic, French fries tipped frozen from a plastic bag into the deep fryer. Along the perimeter of the foodcourt, banks of seats winged around the deck, ready for so many more than the scant dozens who buzzed with society. Nigel and Alisha looked at the portions of reheated food the staff ladelled from their hotel trays in amazement. In their larder he carried everything they needed.

They found seats across from a couple lounging in fleeces and hardshells, chattering in another language. Alisha looked out the porthole over the sea to the east. Another crepuscular ray broke through and dappled her eye, a moment of sparkling illumination that Nigel witnessed pass over her. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale." The children from the deck joined the line at the cafeteria, accompanied by their parents.

"I never stopped thinking about you. Not an hour passed that I didn't think about you." Her eyes were dark under the pot lights.

"I waited for you."

"But---I wouldn't blame you if you hadn't, Nigel." Her gaze broke when she said this.

"Why? You knew that I loved you. It was just two months. Why wouldn't I wait?"

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed her head against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to stretch his arms over her.

"I'll never give up on you," she said, looking up at him. He smiled. The man across from them gazed serene out the porthole.

"Let's get out of here."

***

The hardwood floor of the ballroom undulated beneath their feet. The liquor cabinets behind the bar were locked, but he kept looking through the cupboards. All they found were bottles of cleaning supplies, and a box of individually-portioned peanut butters and jams.

"We'll get something much better than that," she said, pointing her finger to the label on the box.

They moved through a hatch along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door, they could see through the uncovered glass into identical cabins. They were all empty; the one they entered was identical to the others. An entire luxury suite at their disposal, but all the consumables were locked away.

He turned the faucet in the miniaturized tub. Hot water sprayed in a steady stream from the showerhead. "The water works."

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two big, fluffy white cotton towels cradled in her arms. His movements were still weighed down, clung to by a wooden encumbrance. Was she now overcompensating, to bring him out of their momentary fall back into the world they had left behind?

"Come on, babe, let's take a shower." He glanced through the door of the bathroom, through the steam that issued forth, across the bed where they had left their bags, towards the door that led back into the corridor.

"We can't lock it." She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell. Two small moles stood out along the ribs under her left breast.

"Don't worry, babe, no-one's going to come." She peeled off her panties, jumped into the tub, and peeked around the curtain. "Come on, babe, it's warm in here," she said. It was when she peered at him half-hidden and used her small voice that he could not contain himself. He bared his teeth at her, growled, and pulled off his shirt.

***

It was early evening when they disembarked on the island.

"We're in it now," he said. They were past the spring equinox: days were getting longer, but they had no more than an hour of light left.

"Are you scared?"

"We don't know where we're going, and we don't have much light left. We're low on food. It seems cold out here. We don't know the terrain. I'm worried we're in over our head."

"It's okay. We're just going to drive a little bit, until we find somewhere nice and quiet to camp. Then maybe we can build a fire!" She ended with this exclamation, excited by the prospect, even if he knew it was too late and they wouldn't have the energy.

They drove through the village they had disembarked in. Low, prefab metal houses with yards studded the uneven hills; the dirt roads surged up and down and around bends. They didn't know where they were going, but knew that this was the main road: signs for Highway Number One oriented them in the one direction that remained open to them.

"Hey, look, there's a dep!" He pointed at a building that looked like the houses, except its front was faced with glass vitrines. They could see through Venetian blinds into a light-up interior. A neon "open" sign glowed over the door. She pulled the car up to the porch, its construction of wooden planks ostentatious in the settlement built up entirely out of metal and other imported materials. Inside, the shelves were sparsely stocked with junk food and canned goods. Each item stood alone and resembled nothing more than a museum display.

The terrain was wide, hilly, sparsely populated with the occasional copse of coniferous trees [TK] coming to pale yellow-green life in the late spring. The road would sweep round the perimeter of cliffs; they could stop and look West, back over the invisible mainland that seemed like a different world, a life they had left behind; now they were four days on the road, stopping early when they found a pretty spot they could be alone and make a fire. Their bag of coffee was holding out; they stopped every few days and marvelled at the price of the colourless wilted vegetables that had come in on double-linked shipping containers. They opted for bread and fats. "Even Angels Eat" [TK, Milton].

"I've got to get it done today. I just need a couple hours, like two hours or so."

"It's fine, babe," she said, laying her hand on his tense chest. "We'll find you a spot. Don't worry."

She drove through the next roadside settlement, looking around for any public space where he could use his laptop. Aside from one church museum that was closed, they only saw a dozen homes built in proximity to each other. They had given up and resigned themselves to drive on another hour to the next settlement, they passed a low, white building on the edge of town. The windows were boarded up with whitewashed planks. The strip of gravel in front was empty. A red sign glowed *open* above the white-handled door. A wide river spread fat behind the house.

"What could this possibly be?" Nigel asked.

"Let's try it!" she said.

***

Inside it was dark. When they opened the door, they got a wide glimpse of the place in the shaft of light. Just another room, a few cheap tables scattered about for non-existent clientele. Their dilating perception was drawn to the only light in the room, behind the bar.

"Oh! Hello," the man sitting at the corner near them said. He stood up from the pile of papers strewn around the surface by his stool.

"Welcome! Come on in!" The proprietor was taken by surprise, but wanted them to stay.

"My name's Ray."

"Hi Ray." Alisha stepped forward. "Can we come in?"

"Of course! Of course you can come in." He was affronted. "If the sign's on, I'm open! Come on in, take a seat, and tell me what I can get for you. Cash only please."

"My name is Alisha, and this is Nigel. He needs to access the internet, and he needs somewhere he can do some work. Three hours, tops. Do you have wireless internet here?"

"Do I?" He paused from his efforts to order the documents and tools and miscellaneous scraps that had spread over most of the bar. He stared at her. "Do I have---? Of course I do! Why, of course I do!"

He flew off through a door behind the bar and returned immediately with another stack of papers. He was taller than them both, his hair longer. It bounced behind his head in a long grey ponytail. He moved with vigour, unrestrained by the paunch that had slipped into the second half of his life. There was nothing to it.

Nigel took his seat at the other end of the bar, took out his ThinkPad and charger.

"Can I plug this in somewhere?"

"What's that?" Ray barely looked up from his papers. Nigel bent over the bar, trying to see if there was an obvious plug somewhere.

Ray looked up from his papers, came over to help. "A plug?" He yanked on a thin white extension cord until it stretched into range of Nigel's taught cable.

"Now what can I get you? Are you just out on a drive?" Ray looked from Nigel to Alisha doubtfully. His worry for them let Nigel see that the man would not be a threat, but as the man spoke he gained a new suspicion. "Not a drive, I mean a---whaddyacallem, road trip?"

"Yeah, we're on a road trip," Nigel said. "I just need to make sure that I'll be able to get online here before we can stop."

"Oh, yes!" Ray resumed rustling, until he pulled out a small paper calendar with pictures of cats and dogs for each month. In the month of September a few years back, Ray had written a string of characters and digits that Nigel entered into the black terminal of his laptop.

"Okay," he said, glancing at Alisha, who leaned on his shoulder and watched his screen with fascination. He showed her a document with comments in the margins. "These are the comments from my editor. I just need to go through them and implement them, then send it back. It won't take long at all, I just need to concentrate."

"What does that one say?"

"That one says the concept of genealogy needs a gloss. A few words to explain what it means."

"Genealogy? Like, family trees?"

"Like family trees, but for values instead of people. Where does a value descend from?"

"Writing? You're writing? I'm a writer, too!" Ray said. "Now what can I get you?"

"How about a couple beers, Ray?" Alisha said. "I'll distract him," she whispered to him, and detached from Nigel. He would glance regretfully down the bar from time to time, where she sat and Ray stood at the gate leading behind the bar, then look back at his screen. She crossed one knee over the other, arched her ankle and touched her hair. Nigel continued glancing at her over his monitor. He took sips from the beer. For the next hour and a half, Ray was constantly trying to address both of them and bring both of them into conversation, while Alisha tried to keep him contained. He slipped through her containment.

"I was born out on that island," he declared. Sliding doors opened onto plywood deck; a hill descended steeply to the forested riverbank. The river swept out pink and gold against the frame of the sliding glass doors. There was a tiny strip of land in the middle of its distance.

"There were houses out there?" Nigel asked, incredulous.

"Houses? Why, yes, there were about...five houses! The one I was born in is still standing. Last one. No-one lives there. Ruined. Everyone else is dead."

Nigel closed the last comment, scrolled to the top of the document, and added another set of the initials "NC" to the string at the end of the filename. He sent it with a single line in the body of the email and was done.

"Should we just call it for the day?" he asked her. "Now that I have a charge, we could watch a movie if we wanted."

"Yeah!" she said, eyes glowing.
