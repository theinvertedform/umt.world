* Camping in the cemetery
* Driving by Peggy's Cove to the ferry
* Exploring the ferry (it's empty)
* Camping by the side of the road; nothing around; fucking; slow \& steady wins the race
* Pausing at the bar to send edits. Old-timer talks about his weed, the island out in the river that he was born on.
* Camping out in a wide field; *Casablanca*, Ryvita, cheese; fucking so vigorously the SUV moves
* Animal conference around the bend; a caribou trots next to the car
* Gros Morne, like the surface of Mars. Walking through an empty information centre, reading the information displays. Eating lobster, but it's small, still young: they're there too early.
* Ice bergs off the northern coast; the power dam, its Sovietesque mass; unpaved roads like in South America
* Final scene: swimming in the freezing river before returning to the city, to work, to life. "I feel young."
