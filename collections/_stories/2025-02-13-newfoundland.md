The white line dividing the two-lane road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"I don't want to go too much further," he said.

"Why not?" Her eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"Nigel, I had one glass of beer three hours ago."

"But look, we don't have to go further anyway. Take the next right here."

She turned the wheel, and they passed through the gates into an empty parking lot. They were on the grounds of a school, with an adjoining sporting complex bigger than the school itself.

"Are you sure?"

"Why not---it's Saturday tomorrow. We'll be gone early. Just pull over there, by those trees. It'll give us a bit of cover."

She turned the wheel again, and they rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers lining the soccer pitch to a copse of trees that marked the edge of the terrain.

"Does it seem level here? It's important that we sleep on level ground, you know, otherwise the blood will pool and our hearts might rupture."

"Our hearts! I think we'll be okay. We'll be gone early, after all," she said, and turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped into the damp night, then re-entered the vehicle through the back doors. The two seats were folded down to create a flat surface that they had piled high with pillows and blankets. Their bags were stowed in the foot-well, pressed up against the front seats. She clambered over the backseat and met him there.

"Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly out there."

"Okay, okay, but no shoes in bed." He sat awkwardly, legs elevated, and kicked off his leather sneakers. She untied her canvas trainers and did the same. The light above the rear-view mirror turned off automatically, but the light from the school was bright enough to illuminate the interior of the car.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We don't have much. A cucumber, some cheese, some bread and hummus. I'll make us sandwiches!"

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, a spoon to spread the hummus, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. She drew the knife through the dark green skin, the pale white flesh, stopping the blade against her thumb.

"Here you are, m'lord," she said, handing him his sandwich.

"*Merci*, m'lady." A slice of cucumber fell onto his napkin as he bit into the bread. The fatty texture of cheese and hummus sparked with the watery acid of the cucumber. He had never tasted anything like it.

The morning sun glowed white through a fog too thick to pierce. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, ignoring or not seeing the beige SUV parked under the trees, its windows covered in steam. It was just before seven.

"Alisha, I think it's time to get up," Nigel mumbled, wiping his eyes.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream," she said, blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep. "I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around. He helped me with the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing." He sat beside her, hand on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him through long lashes. "Can we get a goat?"

They put on their shoes and stood by the flanks of the SUV. Her hair was held down under the mock neck of her yak wool sweater. The hood of his black pullover sweatshirt was up, similarly to keep his hair in place, but pushed back to frame his face. Their bodies were sore from the makeshift bed, from long hours spent sitting; they saluted the sun, hands in the wet grass, and their young bodies were restored.

Nigel took out a small green canvas satchel from the footwell, wherein he kept a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet a small washcloth with a splash of water from their bottle, applied the soap and scrubbed his face.

"We must always be careful to keep our faces clean while we're in hobo-mode," he said. "The world can always tell an unwashed face."

"Oh," she said. "I wouldn't want them to think less of me, because my face isn't clean." She proceeded to scrub the sleep from her eyes with her own washcloth.

They resumed their places with her behind the wheel and he in the passenger seat. While they waited for the engine to warm, he took out his notebook and a roadmap.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's just over three hours, approximately, from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time to stop at a cafe for our morning toilet. Then there's a beach about halfway: we can take a break there."

He looked at her; she looked back, but not in his eye. There was a dreamy smile on her face.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated the word carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing: it fired him. He took hold of her; she yielded with a sigh.

Both lanes of the winding, two-lane road were filled with steady traffic. On occasion, the forest of pines would break; the fog would roll aside and they could see through the low hills to the sea. At the beach, they got their first taste of salt-spray air. Visibility was low, but streaks of bright paint on the wooden houses stood out in the thick white fog. The shanties were on stilts; no-one lived here. The constant wind and moisture peeled the paint from the thin wooden planks. The underside of the houses were hung with tangled netting and rickety traps, strings of buoys to mark the tide. No-one lived here: the houses were just tourist shops, but the season had not yet begun and they remained closed.

They joined the line of cars at the quay, waiting to embark on the ferry. It was a massive ship, complete overkill for their dozen cars. Two tractor-trailers waited in their own lane, each one a double load of linked shipping containers.

A man in an orange safety vest brought them to their parking spot, clustered together with the other passengers in the half-empty loading bay. Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side, a single welded seam running down the middle. She folded the top and clicked the buckle closed.

She held up the car keys and solemnly announced: "I am locking the car doors." The SUV beeped when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. He took her white blue hand, kissed it, breathed warmth onto her cold fingers.

They stood in the open back of the loading deck. The sea churned to white froth with the vibration through the thick metal deck. The peninsula disappeared in the round wall of fog behind them. Nigel looked down its length to where a family stood watching the land recede along with them. A ray broke through the cloudbank overhead. The ferry's engines were taking them out to sea. It vibrated through the soles of Nigel's shoes. Across the way a family stood, children suited in matching tweeds and grave parents behind them.

"I think we're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?" She brought her arms together for him to shield her against the wind.

They moved through the cafeteria. The restaurants save one were closed: the generic cafeteria operated by the ferry company, selling bread wrapped in plastic, or French fries tipped frozen from a plastic bag into the deep fryer. There were seats winged around the deck ready for so many more than the scant dozens buzing with their society. They observed what the cafeteria had to offer without even a modicum of interest. In their larder he carried everything they needed.

They found seats across from a couple lounging in fleeces and hardshells, chattering in another language. Alisha looked out the porthole over the sea to the east. Crepuscular rays dappled her eye, a moment of sparkling illumination that Nigel saw pass over her. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale." The children from the deck joined the line at the cafeteria with their parents behind them.

"I never stopped thinking about you. Not an hour passed that I didn't think about you." Her eyes were dark under the pot lights.

"I waited for you."

"But---I wouldn't blame you if you hadn't, Nigel." Her gaze broke when she said this.

"Why? You knew that I loved you. It was just two months. Why wouldn't I wait?"

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed her head against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to stretch his arms over her.

"I'll never stop loving you," she said, looking up at him. He smiled. The man across from them gazed serene out the porthole.

"Let's go."

The hardwood floor of the ballroom undulated beneath their feet. When Nigel found that the cabinets behind the bar were locked, he kept looking through the cupboards. All they found were a few cleaning supplies, and a box of individually-portioned peanut butters and jams.

"We'll get something much better than that," she said, sticking her finger at the label on the box.

They moved through a hatch along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door, they could see through the uncovered glass into identical cabins. They were all empty, identical; they entered into one. An entire luxury suite at their disposal.

"Does the water work?" she asked. He turned the faucet in the miniaturized tub. Hot water sprayed in a steady stream from the showerhead.

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two of them, big, fluffy white numbers cradled in her arms. Their previous lapse into moodiness was entirely gone from her face. His movements were still weighed down, clung to by a wooden encumbrance. Was she now overcompensating, to bring him out of their momentary fall back into the world they had left behind?

"Come on, babe, let's take a shower." He glanced through the door of the bathroom, through the steam that issued forth, across the bed where they had left their bags, towards the door that led back into the corridor.

"We can't lock it." She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell. Two small moles stood out along the ribs under her left breast.

"Don't worry, babe, no-one's going to come." She peeled off her panties, jumped into the tub, and peeked around the curtain. "Come on, babe, it's warm in here," she said. It was when she peered at him half-hidden and used her small voice that he could not contain himself. He bared his teeth at her, growled, and pulled off his shirt.

It was early evening when they disembarked on the island.

"We're in it now," he said. They were past the spring equinox: days were getting longer, but they had no more than an hour of light left.

"Are you scared?"

"We don't know where we're going, and we don't have much light left. We're low on food. It seems cold out here. We don't know the terrain. I'm worried we're in over our head."

"It's okay. We're just going to drive a little bit, until we find somewhere nice and quiet to camp. Then maybe we can build a fire!" She ended with this exclamation, excited by the prospect, even if he knew it was too late and they wouldn't have the energy.

They drove through the village they had disembarked in. Low, prefab metal houses with yards studded the uneven hills; the dirt roads surged up and down and around bends. They didn't know where they were going, but knew that this was the main road: signs for Highway Number One oriented them in the one direction that remained open to them.

"Hey, look, there's a dep!" He pointed at a building that looked like the houses, except its front was faced with glass vitrines. They could see through Venetian blinds into a light-up interior. A neon "open" sign glowed over the door. She pulled the car up to the porch, its construction of wooden planks ostentatious in the settlement built up entirely out of metal and other imported materials. Inside, the shelves were sparsely stocked with junk food and canned goods. Each item stood alone and resembled nothing more than a museum display.
