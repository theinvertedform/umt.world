The white line dividing the two-lane road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"I don't want to go much further," he said.

"Why not?" Her eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"One glass, and that was hours ago. Don't you trust me?" she asked from behind the wheel.

"I do trust you---"

"I'm a good driver. My dad was a race car driver. He taught me how to roll. You don't have to worry."

"Let's go in there," he said, indicating the sign that cut off the semi-rural road.

"Into a school?"

She turned the wheel nonetheless, and brought them through a low gate into the empty parking lot. It was a low building lit with a spotlight; there was a huge annexing lot to host traffic to the adjoining sports complex.

"Are you sure?" Their vehicle sat at the entrance. In the headlights, they could see the aluminum outline of a pitch and the patch of forest darkness beyond.

"Tomorrow's Saturday, and we'll be gone early. Those trees will give us cover."

They rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers to where the terrain came to an end. She turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped into the damp night, then re-entered through the back doors. The two seats were folded down to create a flat bed piled high with pillows and blankets. Under the foot-well their bags were pressed up against the front seats. She clambered into the back and met him there.

"Are you still hungry, dear? Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly."

"No shoes in the marital bed." He kicked off his leather sneakers; then he unlaced her canvas trainers and sat them in the driver's seat. The bulb above the rear-view mirror switched off, but the spotlight from the school cast an elusive illumination into the interior of the car.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We've got a cucumber, some cheese. I'll make us sandwiches, like we had on the farm. It was on a hill, but they built it to be level. We would have a pickle, sauerkraut, or fermented goat's milk with every meal. Almost an entire month. Then I had another pickle when I got to Berlin. It wasn't as good, but it was just from a stall at 4am."

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, a spoon to spread the hummus, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. She drew the blade through the vegetable's dark green screen, its watery flesh, and stopped it against her thumb.

"With my compliments, sir," she said, handing him his portion.

"*Merci, mademoiselle*." A piece of cucumber fell onto his napkin as he bit into the bread. The fatty texture of the hummus combined with the cheese into an opulent texture, sparked with the watery acid.

"It was a bit reckless to go out for dinner without having somewhere to stay," he said.

"But I wanted to celebrate being together again. It's been two months, Nigel, and we didn't have time to do anything before we started driving. I wanted candlelight and wine."

***

The morning sun glowed somewhere behind a thick canopy of white fog. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, ignoring or not seeing the beige SUV parked under the trees, windows steamed out. The analogue clock on the dash read just before seven.

"I think it's time to get up," Nigel mumbled, pulling himself from the warmth they had breathed into the cocoon of blankets.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream," she said, blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep. "I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around. He helped me take care of the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing." He sat beside her, hand on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him. "Can we get a goat?"

They put on their shoes and stood along the flanks of the SUV. Her hair was held down under the mock neck of her yak-wool sweater. The hood of his black pullover was up, pushed back to frame his face and pin his hair in place. Hands in the wet grass, they saluted the concealed sun and were restored.

Nigel took out a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet the square of fabric with a splash of water from their bottle, apply a few drops of soap and scrub his face.

"We must always wash our face," he said. "It's a sign of respect for the world we are about to encounter."

"Oh," she said. "It's like how we do it to please God." She proceeded to wash the sleep from her eyes with her own washcloth.

He thought for a moment, as this idea had never occurred to him. "Ablutions."

The engine block turned slowly, warming in its groove. His notebook had a page with a list of dates and locations. Although he did not want to look at it, in this case he needed a reminder.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's a bit over three hours from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time to stop at the beach and take a break."

Alisha's eyes were fixed on him, but not his eye. She was watching his mouth with a coy expression.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing. He took hold of her and she yielded with a sigh.

***

They were early to embark. She turned the engine off, and they stood out in a patch of grass next to the visitor's centre. The *Leif Ericson* could swallow many times the dozen cars that waited in queue. Two tractor-trailers waited in a separate lane, each one pulling a double load of linked shipping containers.

A man in an orange safety vest brought them to their parking spot. Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side. Down its side ran a single welded seam. She gave the top a loose fold, clasped the buckle before swinging it onto her back and putting on her sunglasses.

"I am locking the car doors," she announced with solemn deliberation. The SUV honked when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. When she removed the hand out of her pocket, he took it, kissed it, breathed onto her white fingers.

Vibrations from the engine came through through the soles of Nigel's shoes. They churned the sea to a huge expanse of white froth in their wake. The peninsula disappeared in the round wall of fog behind them. Nigel looked down its length to where a boy and a girl stood with their grave parents behind them. Together they watched land disappear from view. Beams broke through the cloudbank.

"We're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?"

They were buoyed by a south wind that blowing cold fresh life across the deck. Alisha turned away from the water, brought her arms together for him to warm her.

***

Along the perimeter of the common deck winged banks of empty blue vinyl seats. Alisha looked out the porthole over the sea to the east. A crepuscular ray dappled her eye, a moment of illumination that Nigel saw pass over her in a flash before it came upon him. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale." She was a sparkling outline in his overwhelmed vision.

"I thought about you every minute I was gone."

"Nothing moved while you were gone. I was holding my breath."

"Maybe you should have moved on." Her eyes broke.

"It was just two months. Why wouldn't I wait?"

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to put his arm around her.

"I never stopped thinking about you," she said, looking up at him.

"Let's go."

***

They moved through a hatch along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door lay identical, pristine, empty cabins.

When he turned the faucet, hot water sprayed in a steady stream from the showerhead. "The water works."

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two of them cradled in her arms, big and white and fluffy.

"Come on, babe, let's take a shower." He glanced through the door of the bathroom, through the steam that issued forth, across the bed where they had left their bags, towards the hatch that connected the corridor.

"Lock the door." She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell.

"Don't worry, no-one's going to come." She whipped off her clothes, jumped into the tub, peeked around the edge of the shower's plastic shell. "It's warm in here," she said. When she peered at him half-hidden, he couldn't help himself. He bared his teeth, growled with a savage grin, and tore himself naked.

***

"We're in it now," he said when they disembarked. Days were getting longer, but this one was already drawing into evening. They were in unfamiliar terrain without a plan of where to go.

"Are you scared?"

"There's not much light left. We don't know where we're going."

"Let's build a fire!" She was the one who brought forth the possibility. If they could find their mantle here, they could find it anywhere.

The village where they had disembarked was a motley assortment of prefab houses that studded the uneven hills, criss-crossed with dirt roads that eventually brought them to the highway heading north. On their second night, they parked in the hollow of a beach and made a fire.

The road would sweep in undulating curves around the perimeter of cliffs; looking west they saw nothing in the direction of the mainland. Now they were four days on the road. They marvelled at the price of the wilted vegetables that came from double-linked shipping containers. They opted for bread and fats.

***

Nigel opened his backpack, checked his laptop. The battery was low. "I'm down to the wire. I just need a few hours."

"Don't worry, babe. I'll find you a spot." She put her hand in his to reassure them of their connection. "I promise."

The sun already hung mid-afternoon when they found themselves trawling a dozen thin buildings joined by unpainted roads, searching around in vain for somewhere they could post up. Down the road three hours the next town wouldn't be different, and it would be dark. On their way they found a low, white building, its windows boarded up with whitewashed plywood. A red sign glowed *open* above the white-handled door. The river spread fat down the hill out back.

"Let's try it!" she said.

***

Nigel's contracted pupils caught a brief outline of scattered chairs waiting for someone to sit in them. Their dilating perception was pulled to the only light in the room.

"Who's there? I mean---hello," a man said. He stood up from the corner of the bar nearest the door, where papers were strewn everywhere.

"Are you open?" Alisha asked, stepping forward.

"Open! Of course I'm open!" Despite his affront, Nigel could recognize the rasp a voice unused to talking.

"My name's Ray. If the sign's on, I'm open. Don't get too many visitors around here. What's your name? What can I get for you?"

"I'm Alisha. This is Nigel. He needs to use the internet and do some computer work. It'll only take a few hours. Do you have wireless internet here?"

"Do I?" He paused in his efforts to sweep together the documents and tools and pieces of scrap that had spread across the bar. He stared at her. "Do I have---? Why, of course I do!"

Behind the plywood bar hung a shelf that held half a dozen glasses and a mickey of Jameson; underneath it was a mini-fridge. He disappeared through a door behind the bar and returned immediately with still more papers. Ray was heavier than Nigel, powerfully built and tall. His grey hair was gathered in a ponytail; he moved with vigour, unrestrained by the paunch that had slipped into the second half of his life. There was nothing to it.

Nigel took his seat at the far end of the bar, took out his ThinkPad and the charging cable.

"Can I plug this in somewhere?"

"What's that?" Ray looked up, then came over to help. "A plug?" He yanked on a thin white extension cord until it stretched into range of Nigel's taught cable.

"Now what can I get you? You're on on a drive?" Ray looked from Nigel to Alisha. His concern for them defused the threat of his stature. "Not a drive, I mean a---whaddyacallem, road trip?"

"I just need to make sure that I can get online."

"Oh, yes!" Ray produced a small paper calendar, pictures of cats and dogs for each month. In the month of September two years back, he had written a string of characters and digits that Nigel entered into the black terminal of his laptop.

"Okay," he said to Alisha, draped across his shoulder. She watched his screen with fascination. He showed her a document with comments in the margins. "I just need to go through my editor's comments, deal with them, then send it back."

"What does that one say?"

"That one says 'faith' needs a gloss. A few words to explain what it means."

"Faith? I thought it was about communism."

"Faith is the main question of human existence. It's time the communists get a reminder."

"What can I get you?" Ray asked.

"We'll take two beers, Ray." Alisha said. After Ray took two bottles of ale from the minifridge, she detached herself from Nigel and went down to the other end of the bar.

"Where are you headed?" Alisha tried to focus his attention, but he continued to address both of them.

Down at the other end of the bar, she was perched on her stool with her back arched, ignoring him. Ray stood on the other side. Nigel glanced back at his screen. She crossed one leg over the other, pointed her foot coquettishly and touched her hair. She didn't look at him. Nigel took a pull from the bottle.

"The north ferry?" Ray was surprised. "It's dangerous up there. Cold. Better have extra batteries for your radio. Just one spare tire? What---no radio? You don't have a proper spare?"

*The integral nature of _faith_ as a concluding statement represents a significant development in Kierkegaard's conceptual canon compared to that of Nietzsche. For the anti-Christian philosopher, several of the issues that the concept of faith responds to are instead accounted for by other concepts, most significantly that of the _over-man_.*

"I was born out on that island," Ray said. Sliding glass doors opened onto a patch of flat grass; Nigel could see the first in a series of steps cut into the steep declension that led down to the forested riverbank. The water swept up blue and peach gold, framed by the sliding doors. The thin black line of the far shore cut the river from the sky. In the middle distance, a narrow brown smudge against the pastel water.

"There are houses out there?" Nigel asked, incredulous.

"Houses? Yes, about...five houses! The one I was born in is still standing. Last one. The rest are ruined. They're all dead. Just me and mum left."

Nigel closed the last of the document's comment and added another set of the initials "NC" to the sequence at the end of the filename. He sent it to his editor with a single line in the body of the email.

"It's getting late," he said, standing next to Alisha. "Now that I have a charge, we could watch a movie."

"Okay!" she said, eyes glowing.

"Go down there," Ray said. He pointed past his house, to where the road led down towards the river. Nigel took a toke from the joint Ray had lit. "There's a big plateau. No-one goes down there. I grew this myself. Let me show you."

They couldn't, said goodbye instead and drove down the hill. She stopped the car in the middle of a grass field. The sky was enormous overhead. He put on *Casablanca* while she pushed the cushions into a headboard they could lean against, then they ate Ryvita and yellow cheese while the darkening sky merged with the river.

When she wanted to touch him, he realized that the weed had made him shy and self-conscious. He explored the outline of her hipbones without speaking. They lay on their sides, laptop discarded. His shyness left him as she pressed her body into him. The sun would not set. Long grasses blew in an invisible wind. They pushed outwards against the inside of the SUV, against the roof, against the windows; pushed down into the cushions of their bed.

***

Nothing in this world is fixed: not even the continents. They drift, the earth itself buoyed imperceptibly by currents in the water and air. It's inevitable that one plate crashed into another. Gentle first, but over millions of years, the great mass of these forces builds. They crush into each other. The force of their collision shrouds the globe in tempest and strife. Storm clouds last eons. Plant species die out, animals teach their young to hide: but there is nowhere to hide from the lightning strikes, from the earthquakes and volcanoes erupting ash and molten lava. By the end of this unstable era, when the quaking has subsided and the sun shines through again, the mantle of one of these land masses comes out on top. Through arcane processes beyond the ken of man, the spiral of obduction points to one peripheral point: a lonely island, there to throw up rolling highland fields and ancient mountain ranges of desolate pale-orange rock, whose texture is unseen anywhere else on the surface of the earth. The exposed mantle found here is so rich in iron that life cannot propagate, except for certain purple-green plants that look like a mutated species of a seed dredged up from the ocean floor. They emerge from the crevice of broken stones, as though their roots had split them.

"The left pedal is for the brake, the right pedal is for the gas. This is your turning signal: use it every time you change lanes. That's the cruise control. Don't go over 90." The stretches of highway were so long, the curves gentle and the traffic so sparse that he quickly grew confident behind the wheel. She would let him spend an hour or more driving while she consulted the map.

"We're coming up on the exit for the terminal. Slow down." They were on a straight stretch, no cars in either direction. The exit was on their left, through the grass meridian that split the highway in two directions. He pressed the brake.

"Slow down." They were up to the exit; he needed to turn the wheel. "Slow down!" The beige SUV drifted around the corner. He heard, very distinctly, a screeching followed by a faint metal clattering. He waited for the car to level out before he pumped the brakes. They came to a stop halfway in the ditch.

"You almost killed us!"

"What do you mean? We're fine."

"If this was a car, we would have flipped! Didn't you hear me say slow down?"

"I did slow down." He felt calm. She was over-reacting.

"Get out!" He closed the door quietly while she slammed hers. The beige SUV was tilted halfway into the ditch. She was panting, and he was astonished to see tears standing out on her face.

"Look at that!" She indicated the road behind them. He saw four long black streaks burned into the pavement. "You were skidding! Don't you know how dangerous that is?"

"It was an accident."

She was examining the car now. "Look at this!" She pointed at the rear passenger-side wheel. "We lost a hubcap, Nigel!"

"Don't worry, I see it, it's just down there." He trotted down the road. Silence rang in his ears. The ferry terminal was just another low hill on the horizon. When he returned with the metal disc in hand, she was squatted by the SUV's driver's-side flank, her back leaning against it. She was crying.

"I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen. I tried to stop it, but you wouldn't listen to me."

"I thought I was in control."

"You weren't in control. We're in the ditch now."

***

Returning to the mainland did not take a full two hours. The *Qajaq W.* had no cabins, just an observation deck with a few vending machines. They watched icebergs float by and he thought about how cold the water must be. The sun shone from a new sky that none of us have ever seen before.

The village where they disembarked was in a coastal depression. Up above them rose the top of the forest silhouette; up above it swam unearthly colours of a new sky none of us have ever seen before.

"We're in it now," Alisha said.

Beneath the price of gas read the discrete warning: "next stop 500KM." The station was closed.

"Over half a tank---can we make it?" Nigel asked from the passenger seat.

"We could make it. Maybe, barely. Is it worth it?" She was uncertain; her confidence was shaken.

"Slow and steady." He put his hand on her shoulder, squeezed it, palmed the back of her neck. "That's how we'll get through this." She looked at him; her brows uncreased, smoothed, and the line of her mouth bent into a bow.

***

She started driving to get the lay of the land. It became immediately apparent: just a straight gravel road that continued on through uncultivated forest. Its ungodliness threatened to overwhelm him. The exposed rockhills, the hardy trees in all their variety held deep terror for him. That was the world: savage and cruel. She wanted to make a fire, to find a bower in the world and line it with flowers. He felt the unhomeliness of the world pressing against the thin skein that separated them from the night.

"Put it on cruise control and keep it at 60. These stones could easily puncture a tire. Try to avoid any big ones. If we have to, the donut won't get us far."

***

They were in an endless aisle of aspens, wild bush growing at the top of long trunks. The sun filtered through at the same low angle where it hovered without moving all day long. They had pulled over to the side of the road, barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass. The black pickup with whom they had disembarked stopped to see if they were okay: they were all alone out there, after all. No help was coming, and therefore all must help each other. Nigel gave them a thumbs-up and a wave from the backseat. She trembled beneath him, soft pants around her knees. All he could see of her face was a single red cheek, the other half pressed into the pillow. He watched a bead stand still for a moment before running down, unable to tell if it was sweat or tears. Her face was pressed into the pillow; she cried out.

***

"What's that!" They had come up on the crest of a clearing in the forest. Nigel pumped the brakes, but they had already made their interruption. A hawk flew off to hide behind a cloud. A fox ran into the forest, and a rabbit ran in the other direction. The caribou came up to them, indignant and stern. He trotted next to the SUV while the two sat frozen inside. Nigel kept them inching forward, his foot light to the pedal. They held their breath. It cantered around to examine Alisha more closely with its brown eye. Nigel saw that while the spirit huffed, he was not angry. He was only checking them out, and would allow them to continue on their way so that he could return to the forest.

***

The roads worsened the further south they got. They were high up in the mountains now. The only traffic they passed were construction vehicles, huge tractors or trucks or other SUVs, dirty from moving from one construction site to another. The dirt road went up and down and wound around bends. Nigel felt out of his element behind the wheel, with an unprotected drop on one side and roaring cement trucks constantly passing on the other. He gripped the wheel tight but didn't wake Alisha. He came around one bend, and had to turn the wheel quickly to give a tractor pulling a load of timber logs enough space to pass without crushing them.

Alisha woke up as they were cresting a mountain. She lay back in her seat for a moment, blinking, before she raised herself to look out at the valley spread with forest out the window to her right. Dark green and pale yellow.

"Wait---what *is* that?" she asked.

"I have no idea. I've been watching it get closer for hours now. It's absolutely massive.

"It's our sign," he said. "They put it there for us."

***

They were now distinctly hurrying. Only two days left before they were scheduled at work. Just before the cities started, they were peering around on a bright morning when the sun was hot, the air cold blowing off the plateau.

"I want to go for a swim," she insisted. "I want to jump in the river."

They were on a conventional four-lane highway at this point. Signs of civilization were still spread out, but they had unmistakeably returned to the straight world. She pulled off the highway; they drove down a long access road until they saw somewhere to stop. The water was clear here, down a short grade to a bank of jagged rocks. They stripped down to their underwear, took their towels and clambered down to the water. It was freezing cold: cold enough to take the breath away. They both hissed and gasped and sputtered. He was standing there, bracing in the wind and the sun, water streaming off his body. She took out her Pentax and snapped a photo.

"I feel young," he said.

"You are young."

"We're young," he said.
