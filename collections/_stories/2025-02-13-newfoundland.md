The white line dividing the two-lane road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"I don't want to go much further," he said.

"Why not?" Her eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"I had one glass, and that was three hours ago. Don't you trust me?" she asked from behind the wheel.

"I do trust you---"

"I'm a good driver, you don't have to worry."

"But we don't have to keep going anyway. Let's go in there," he said, indicating the school sign that cut off the semi-rural road.

"Into a school?"

She turned the wheel nonetheless, and brought them through a low gate into the empty parking lot. It was a low building lit with a spotlight; there was a huge annexing lot to host game day traffic to the adjoining sports complex.

"Are you sure?" Their vehicle sat at the entrance. In the headlights, they could see the aluminum outline of a pitch and the patch of forest darkness beyond.

"Tomorrow's Saturday, and we'll be gone early. Just pull over there, by those trees. They'll give us some cover."

They rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers to where the terrain came to an end.

"Does it seem level here? Otherwise the blood will pool and our hearts might rupture."

"Don't worry. We'll be gone early, after all," she said, and turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped into the damp night, then re-entered through the back doors. The two seats were folded down to create a flat bed piled high with pillows and blankets. Under the foot-well their bags were pressed up against the front seats. She clambered into the back and met him there.

"Are you still hungry, dear? Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly."

"No shoes in bed." He sat awkwardly, legs elevated, and kicked off his leather sneakers; then he unlaced her canvas trainers and sat them in the driver's seat. The bulb above the rear-view mirror switched off, but the spotlight from the school cast an elusive illumination into the interior of the car.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We've got a cucumber, some cheese. I'll make us sandwiches, like we had on the farm. It was on a hill, but they built it to be level. We would have a pickle, sauerkraut, or fermented goat's milk with every meal. Almost an entire month. Then I had another pickle when I got to Berlin. It wasn't as good, but it was just from a stall at 4am."

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, a spoon to spread the hummus, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. She drew the blade through the vegetable's dark green screen, its watery flesh, and stopped it against her thumb.

"With my compliments, sir," she said, handing him his portion.

"*Merci, mademoiselle*." A piece of cucumber fell onto his napkin as he bit into the bread. The fatty texture of the hummus combined with the cheese into an opulent texture, sparked with the watery acid.

"It was a bit reckless to go out for dinner without having somewhere to stay," he said.

"But I wanted to celebrate being together again. It's been two months, Nigel, and we didn't have time to do anything before we started driving. I wanted candlelight and wine."

***

The morning sun glowed somewhere behind a thick canopy of white fog. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, ignoring or not seeing the beige SUV parked under the trees, windows steamed out. The analogue clock on the dash read just before seven.

"I think it's time to get up," Nigel mumbled, pulling himself from the warmth they had breathed into the cocoon of blankets.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream," she said, blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep. "I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around. He helped me take care of the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing." He sat beside her, hand on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him. "Can we get a goat?"

They put on their shoes and stood along the flanks of the SUV. Her hair was held down under the mock neck of her yak-wool sweater. The hood of his black pullover was up, pushed back to frame his face and pin his hair in place. Hands in the wet grass, they saluted the concealed sun and were restored.

Nigel took out a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet the square of fabric with a splash of water from their bottle, apply a few drops of soap and scrub his face.

"We must always wash our face," he said. "It's a sign of respect for the world we are about to encounter."

"Oh," she said. "It's like how we do it to please God." She proceeded to wash the sleep from her eyes with her own washcloth.

He thought for a moment, as this idea had never occurred to him. "Ablutions."

The engine block turned slowly, warming in its groove. His notebook had a page with a list of dates and locations. Although he did not want to look at it, in this case he needed a reminder.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's a bit over three hours from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time to stop at the beach and take a break."

Alisha's eyes were fixed on him, but not his eye. She was watching his mouth with a coy expression.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing. He took hold of her and she yielded with a sigh.

***

They were early to embark. She turned the engine off, and they stood out in a patch of grass next to the visitor's centre. The *Leif Ericson* could swallow many times the dozen cars that waited in queue. Two tractor-trailers waited in a separate lane, each one pulling a double load of linked shipping containers.

A man in an orange safety vest brought them to their parking spot. Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side. Down its side ran a single welded seam. She gave the top a loose fold, clasped the buckle before swinging it onto her back and putting on her sunglasses.

"I am locking the car doors," she announced with solemn deliberation. The SUV honked when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. When she removed the hand out of her pocket, he took it, kissed it, breathed onto her white fingers.

Vibrations from the engine came through through the soles of Nigel's shoes. They churned the sea to a huge expanse of white froth in their wake. The peninsula disappeared in the round wall of fog behind them. Nigel looked down its length to where a boy and a girl stood with their grave parents behind them. Together they watched land disappear from view. Beams broke through the cloudbank.

"We're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?"

They were buoyed by a south wind that blowing cold fresh life across the deck. Alisha turned away from the water, brought her arms together for him to warm her.

***

The cafeteria sold bread wrapped in plastic. A teenager tipped French fries frozen from a plastic bag into the deep fryer while an unfazed woman took orders. Along the perimeter of the common deck winged banks of seats ready for so many more than the scant dozens buzzing with society.

They found seats across from a couple lounging in fleeces and hardshells, chattering in another language. Alisha looked out the porthole over the sea to the east. A crepuscular ray dappled her eye, a moment of illumination that Nigel saw pass over her in a flash before it came upon him. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale," she said, a sparkling outline in his overwhelmed vision.

"Not an hour passed where I didn't think about you. Did you think about me?" she asked.

"Always. The city was completely still while you were gone. Nothing moved. I was holding my breath."

"I wouldn't blame you if you had moved on, Nigel." Her gaze broke.

"It was just two months. Why wouldn't I wait?"

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed her head against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to stretch his arms over her.

"I never stopped thinking about you," she said, looking up at him.

"Let's go."

***

They moved through a hatch along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door lay identical, pristine, empty cabins.

When he turned the faucet, hot water sprayed in a steady stream from the showerhead. "The water works."

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two of them cradled in her arms, big and white and fluffy.

"Come on, babe, let's take a shower." He glanced through the door of the bathroom, through the steam that issued forth, across the bed where they had left their bags, towards the door that led back into the corridor.

"We can lock it." She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell. Two had two small moles under her right breast.

"Don't worry, no-one's going to come." She peeled off her clothes, jumped into the tub, and peeked around the edge of the shower's plastic shell. "It's warm in here," she said. It was when she peered at him half-hidden that he couldn't help himself. He bared his teeth at her, growled, and pulled off his shirt.

***

"We're in it now," he said when they disembarked. They were past the spring equinox: days were getting longer, but the day was already drawing into evening. They were in unfamiliar terrain and didn't know where they were going.

"Are you scared?"

"We don't have much light left, and we don't know where we're going."

"We can build a fire." She said it like a child, delighted by some prospect.

The village where they had disembarked was a motley assortment of prefab houses that studded the uneven hills, criss-crossed with dirt roads that eventually brought them to the highway heading north. On their second night, they parked in the hollow of a beach and made a fire.

The road would sweep in undulating curves around the perimeter of cliffs; looking west they saw nothing in the direction of the mainland. Now they were four days on the road. They marvelled at the price of the wilted vegetables that had come in on double-linked shipping containers. They opted for bread and fats.

Nigel opened his backpack, checked his laptop. The battery was low. "I've got to get it done today. Just two or three hours."

"Don't worry, babe. I'll find you a spot." She put her hand on his chest. "I promise."

They crawled through the next settlement. A dozen thin buildings were connected by regular roads; a few benches on a hill, built with state-approved materials and state-approved design. On the edge of town was spread a low, white building, its windows boarded up with whitewashed plywood. The strip of gravel in front was empty. A red sign glowed *open* above the white-handled door. The river spread fat down the hill out back.

"Let's try it!" she said.

***

Inside was dark. When they opened the door, Nigel's contracted pupils caught a brief outline of scattered chairs waiting for someone to sit in them. Their dilating perception was pulled to the only light in the room.

"Who's there? I mean---hello," a man said. He stood up from the corner of the bar nearest the door, where papers were strewn everywhere.

"Are you open?" Alisha asked, stepping forward.

"Open! Of course I'm open!" The man was affronted. Nigel recognized the rasp an atrophied larynx.

"My name's Ray and if the sign's on, I'm open. Don't get too many visitors around here. What's your name? What can I get for you?"

"I'm Alisha, and this is Nigel. He needs to use the internet and do some computer work. It'll only take a few hours. Do you have wireless internet here?"

"Do I?" He paused in his efforts to sweep together the documents and tools and pieces of scrap that had spread across the bar. He stared at her. "Do I have---? Why, of course I do!"

Behind the plywood bar hung a shelf that held half a dozen glasses and a mickey of Jameson; underneath it was a mini-fridge. He disappeared through a door behind the bar and returned immediately with still more papers. Ray was heavier than Nigel, powerfully built and tall. His grey hair was gathered in a ponytail; he moved with vigour, unrestrained by the paunch that had slipped into the second half of his life. There was nothing to it.

Nigel took his seat at the far end of the bar, took out his ThinkPad and the charging cable.

"Can I plug this in somewhere?"

"What's that?" Ray looked up, then came over to help. "A plug?" He yanked on a thin white extension cord until it stretched into range of Nigel's taught cable.

"Now what can I get you? Are you just out on a drive?" Ray looked from Nigel to Alisha. His concern for their comfort let Nigel see that the man would not be a threat; but as he spoke, he gained a new suspicion: Ray would not allow him to get his work done. "Not a drive, I mean a---whaddyacallem, road trip?"

"I just need to make sure that I can get online."

"Oh, yes!" Ray produced a small paper calendar, pictures of cats and dogs for each month. In the month of September a few years back, Ray had written a string of characters and digits that Nigel entered into the black terminal of his laptop.

"Okay," he said, glancing at Alisha, who leaned on his shoulder and watched his screen with fascination. He showed her a document with comments in the margins. "I just need to go through the editor's comments and deal with them, then send it back."

"What does that one say?"

"That one says 'genealogy' needs a gloss. A few words to explain what it means."

"Genealogy? Like, family trees?"

"But for values instead of people."

"Now what can I get you?" Ray asked.

"We'll take two beers, Ray." Alisha said. After Ray took two bottles of ale from the minifridge, she detached herself from Nigel and went down to the other end of the bar.

"Where are you headed?" He tried to address both of them, while Alisha fought to focus his attention.

Nigel looked down the bar, lingering on her. She sat perched on her stool, back arched. Ray stood near her behind the bar. Nigel looked back at his screen. She crossed one knee over the other, pointed her foot coquettishly and touched her hair. Nigel took a pull from the bottle.

"The north ferry?" Ray was surprised. "It's dangerous up there. Make sure you have extra batteries for your radio. How many spare tires do you have? What---no radio? A donut? Not even a proper spare?"

*The integral nature of _faith_ as a concluding statement represents a significant development in Kierkegaard's conceptual canon compared to that of Nietzsche. For the anti-Christian philosopher, several of the issues that the concept of faith responds to are instead accounted for by other concepts, most significantly that of the _over-man_.*

"I was born out on that island," Ray said. Sliding glass doors opened onto a patch of flat grass; Nigel could see the first in a series of steps cut into the steep declension that led down to the forested riverbank. The water swept up pink and peach gold, framed by the sliding doors. The thin black line of the far shore cut the river from the sky. A narrow brown smudge sat in the middle-distance.

"There were houses out there?" Nigel asked, incredulous.

"Houses? Yes, about...five houses! The one I was born in is still standing. Last one. No-one lives there. Ruined. They're all dead. Just me and ma left."

Nigel closed the last comment and added another set of his initials "NC" to the sequence at the end of the filename. He sent it to his editor with a single line in the body of the email.

"It's getting late," he commented. "Now that I have a charge, we could watch a movie."

"Okay!" she said, eyes glowing.

"Go down there," Ray said. He pointed past his house, to where the road led down towards the river. Nigel took a toke from the joint Ray had lit. "There's a big plateau. No-one goes down there. I grew this myself."

They drove down the hill and she stopped the car in the middle of a grass field. The sky was enormous overhead. They could see the island Ray had grown up on more clearly.

They ate Ryvita and yellow cheese, pushing the cushions into a headboard they could sit up against. He put on *Casablanca* and handed her a napkin.

"We're gonna get crumbs in bed," he said.

"No!"

When she wanted to touch him, he realized that the weed had made him shy and self-conscious. He explored the outline of her hipbones without speaking, and entered her slowly from behind. They lay on their sides, laptop discarded. His shyness left him. The sun would not set: all around them, long grasses blew in an invisible wind. They pushed outwards against the inside of the SUV, against the roof, against the windows; pushed down into the cushions of their bed.

***

Tectonic plates collide slowly over millions of years. By the end of this unstable eon, the mantle of one of those land masses comes out on top. This process of obduction leaves rolling highland fields and ancient mountain ranges of desolate pale-orange rock, whose texture and quality is unseen anywhere else on the surface of the earth. The exposed mantle is so rich in iron that life cannot propagate here, excepting certain purple-green plants with long roots that look like a species from the ocean floor. They emerge from the crevice of broken stones, as though they themselves had split them; when Nigel bent to examine one more closely, he could see them swarming with insect life.

"The left pedal is for the gas, the right pedal is for the brake. This is your turning signal: use it every time you change lanes. That's the cruise control. Don't go over 90." The stretches of highway were so long, the curves gentle and the traffic so sparse that he became confident behind the wheel, and she would let him spend an hour or more driving while she consulted the map.

"We're coming up on the exit for the terminal. Slow down." They were on a straight stretch, no cars in either direction. The exit was through the grass meridian separating the highway in two directions. He pressed the brakes.

"Slow down, Nigel." They were up to the exit; he needed to turn the wheel. "Slow down!" The beige SUV skidded around the corner. He waited for it to level out, then pumped the brakes. They came to a stop halfway in the ditch.

"You almost killed us!"

"What do you mean? We're fine."

"If this was a normal car, we would have flipped! Didn't you hear me say slow down?"

"I did slow down." He felt perfectly calm: she was the one over-reacting.

"Get out of the car! No more driving for you." He closed the door quietly while she slammed hers. The beige SUV was tilted halfway into the ditch. She was panting, and he was astonished to see tears standing out on her face.

"You almost killed us!"

"It was an accident."

"An accident? How could you be so careless? It wasn't my fault either, Nigel. I didn't want it to happen. It just did."

"What are you talking about?"

***

The northern ferry was only three hours, and was half as big as the southern. There was no cafeteria, no cabin they could sneak into. They watched icebergs float by from the observation deck. The sun shone weak from a clear sky. Nigel had never seen this colour before.

They disembarked at the most far northern point of the mainland. Nothing but gravel roads from here on it.

"Now we're in it," Alisha said.

Highway 1 continued. It took them only a minute to reach the edge of the trailers scattered in community around the disembarkement zone. There were hours of light left, although Nigel couldn't be sure because of how far north they were.

They found the Red Robin gas station on the edge of town. It was also the grocery store. On the large sign, just under the painted price of gas, the sign read "Next gas 500KM." The station was closed.

"Should we continue?" Nigel asked from the passenger seat.

"We've got a bit over half a tank. We could probably make it, but it's not worth it."

"Slow and steady."

***

They found a hill to set up camp on. It looked out over a wild, unsymmetrical forest. Night came on quick and complete. They sat on basted cushions laid out in the dark grass.

"Are we going to see the northern lights?" she asked.

"I hope so."

After filling the SUV's tank with gasoline, she sat behind the wheel again. "I want to know what the road's like before I let you drive again," she said. The road was unpaved gravel, straight, surrounded by forest. "Okay, you can drive. Here, put it on cruise control and keep it at 60, no more. These stones could destroy the tires. We have a donut, but it's fragile. It might not last long enough to get us anywhere."

He kept them on cruise control. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, they pulled over to have sex. A truck that had disembarked with them from the ferry stopped, peered in the window to make sure everything was okay. Nigel gave them a thumbsup and a smile from the backseat; his other hand was deep inside Alisha.

***

They kept driving and driving. Around one bend, they startled a group of animals: a hawk flew off; a fox ran into the forest while a rabbit ran in the other direction; a caribou stood and glared at them, unafraid. Alisha played with the radio, moving from one static band to another. A faint voice emerged: *highway one---washed out---*

"Uh-oh," Nigel said. They kept driving until they came to an off-road that led into a trailer park. Orange road safety signs indicated that the road ahead was closed. They had no choice but to steer their way to the convenience store that served as the community's only grocery store.

"Any idea what's happening up ahead?" Nigel asked the teenage boy behind the counter.

"Beaver made a dam, washed out the road," he said, looking up at them in open-mouthed amazement. Nigel and Alisha were both clad all in black. "Should be clear soon, but I'm not sure."

They loitered for a few minutes, looking at the energy drinks and bags of chips that lined the fully-stocked shelves. A couple kids rode up on dirtbikes, stared at them, bought sodas and left.

"What do we do?"

"We should just continue on," Alisha said. "If it's not cleared yet, we'll find out soon enough. I'll drive."

Further down the road, they passed the road crew, who leaned by their equipment in neon safety gear and watched them roll slowly by.

***

The roads worsened the further south they got. They were high up in the mountains now. The only traffic they passed were construction vehicles, huge tractors or trucks or other SUVs, dirty from moving from one construction site to another. The dirt road went up and down and wound around bends. Nigel felt out of his element behind the wheel, with an unprotected drop on one side and roaring cement trucks constantly passing on the other side of the narrow road. He gripped the wheel tight but didn't wake Alisha. He came around one bend, and had to turn the wheel quickly to give a tractor pulling a load of timber logs enough space to pass without crushing them.

Alisha woke up as they were cresting a mountain.

"What's that?" she asked. There was a humongous series of concrete arches embedded in the side of the mountain, at the base of a river.

"That's our sign," he said. "That's a sign that it's going to be okay. That's our sign to keep on fighting."

***

They were now distinctly hurrying. Only two days left before they were scheduled at work. Just before the cities started, they were peering around on a bright morning when the sun was hot, the air cold blowing off the plateau.

"I want to go for a swim," she insisted. "I want to jump in the river."

They were on a conventional four-lane highway at this point. Signs of civilization were still spread out, but they had unmistakeably returned to the straight world. She pulled off the highway; they drove down a long access road until they saw somewhere to stop. The water was clear here, down a short grade to a bank of jagged rocks. They stripped down to their underwear, took their towels and clambered down to the water. It was freezing cold: cold enough to take the breath away. They both hissed and gasped and sputtered. He was standing there, bracing in the wind and the sun, water streaming off his body. She took out her Pentax and snapped a photo.

"I feel young," he said.

"You are young."

"We're young," he said.
