The white line dividing the road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"We need to stop soon," Nigel said.

"I'm fine to keep driving for a while." Alisha didn't take her eyes from the road.

"But---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"I had one glass, and that was hours ago. Don't you trust me?"

"I do trust you---"

"My dad was a race car driver. He taught me how to roll. You don't have to worry."

"Let's go in there," he said, indicating the sign that cut off the semi-rural road.

"There? It's a school."

"Trust me."

She turned the wheel and brought them through a low gate. A single spotlight lit the schoolhouse.

"Are you sure?" In the headlights, they could see the aluminum outline of a pitch, a patch of dark forest beyond.

"Tomorrow's Saturday, and we'll be gone early. We can take cover under those trees."

They rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers to where the terrain came to an end. She turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" The two seats of the SUV were folded down to create a flat bed piled high with pillows and blankets. She clambered into the back while he opened and shut the door.

"Are you still hungry, dear? Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly."

"No shoes in bed." He kicked off his leather sneakers, then he unlaced her canvas trainers and set them in the driver's seat. She watched him quietly, lips parted. The bulb above the rearview mirror switched off, leaving the interior of the vehicle cast in the elusive illumination from the distant spotlight.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote that served as their larder. "We've got a cucumber, some cheese. I'll make us sandwiches. On the farm, we ate a lot of goat cheese. We had lots of cucumbers, too, always pickled. A pickle or some sauerkraut every day for almost an entire month. Then I had another pickle when I got to Berlin. It wasn't as good, but it was just from a stall at 4am."

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, along with two blue napkins that they used as plates.

"What were you doing out at 4am?"

"Partying. You've been to Berlin. You know how it is."

She drew the blade through the vegetable's dark skin, stopped it against her thumb. After assembling the ingredients, she handed him his portion. Hummus and cheese combined to create an opulent texture, sparked by the watery acid of the vegetable.

"It was reckless to go out for dinner without a plan for afterwards." A piece of cucumber fell onto his napkin.

"But we were apart for two months. I missed you. I wanted candlelight and wine."

"It was worth it."

***

The morning sun glowed distant behind a canopy of white fog. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. The clock on the dash read just before seven.

"It's time to get up," he mumbled, pulling himself from the warmth they had breathed into their cocoon.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream." Blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep.

"I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around and help me take care of the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing."

His hand was on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him. "Can we get a goat?"

They stood by the flanks of the SUV in the wet grass and bent the stiffness from their limbs. Nigel took out a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castile soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet the square of fabric with a splash of water from their bottle, apply a few drops of soap and scrub his face.

"We wash our face in the morning to show respect for the world we are about to encounter."

"Oh," she said. "Like how we do it to please God." She began to wash the sleep from her own eyes.

He thought for a moment. "It's an ablution."

***

The engine block turned slowly, warming in its groove. His notebook had a page with a list of dates and locations.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's a bit over three hours from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time."

Alisha looked at him, eyes half-lidded. She was watching his mouth with a coy expression.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing. He took hold of her, and she yielded with a sigh.

***

The *Leif Ericson* could hold many times more than the dozen cars that waited in queue, than the two tractor-trailers parked in their own lane, each one linked with a double load of shipping containers. A man in an orange safety vest waved them to their spot.

Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side. Down its side ran a single welded seam. She gave the top a loose fold, clasped the buckle before swinging it onto her back. Her hair was pinned down in the mock neck of her yak wool sweater. She put on her sunglasses and gave him a smile.

"I am locking the car doors," she announced with solemn deliberation. The SUV honked when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. When she pulled her hand back out, he took it, breathed onto her white fingers.

Vibrations from the engine came through the soles of Nigel's shoes. They churned the sea to a huge expanse of white froth in their wake. The peninsula disappeared in a round wall of fog. Beams broke through the cloud bank.

"We're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?"

A south wind buoyed them, blowing cold fresh life across the deck. Alisha turned away from the water, brought her arms together for him to shield her.

***

Empty blue vinyl seats were bolted in winged banks along the perimeter of the observation deck. Alisha looked out the porthole to the east. A crepuscular ray dappled her eye, a moment of illumination that Nigel saw pass over her in a flash before it fell upon him. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale." With the sun in his eye, she was just a silhouette whose edges sparkled.

"I held my breath the whole time you were away," he told her. She did not look away from the window.

"Oh," she said after a moment.

"Even after everything that happened before you left, I never stopped believing. It wasn't a big deal."

"It was a big deal to me. Things were out of control. I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't understand."

She kept looking out the window while he sank into a slump beside her.

"Maybe you shouldn't have waited." She turned her head to look at him. "That's why I went alone. I wanted us to take time. I wanted both of us to be sure."

"I am sure. Even if it seems impossible. That's what commitment is."

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to put his arm around her.

"I thought about you every minute," she said, looking up at him.

***

They moved along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door they passed lay identical, pristine, empty cabins. They found one hatch unlocked, slid the deadbolt into place behind them, and deposited their bags by the bed. When he turned the faucet, hot water sprayed from the shower head. "The water works."

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two of them cradled in her arms, big and white and fluffy. "Let's take a shower!"

He glanced through the door of the bathroom towards the hatch that connected to the corridor. She was already undressing, discarding her clothes on the floor.

"Don't worry, babe, it's locked!" She jumped into the tub, peeked around the edge of the shower's plastic shell. "It's warm in here." When she peered at him half-hidden, he couldn't help himself. He bared his teeth, growled, and tore himself naked.

***

"We're in it now," he said when they disembarked. Winter was behind them; the days stretched on, but this one had already descended into evening. They were in unfamiliar terrain without a plan.

"Are you scared?"

"There's not much light left. We don't know where we're going."

"Let's build a fire!" The thought had not occurred to him. She made her home in the world: he merely lived in it. They took the highway heading north. On their second night, they parked in the hollow of a beach and built a fire.

The road swept in undulating curves around the perimeter of ancient cliffs, low stone hills waving with wet yellow grass. Looking west they saw nothing in the direction of the mainland. Now they were four days on the road. When they stopped for supplies, they marvelled at the price of the wilted vegetables that came from double-linked shipping containers. They drank ambrosia, ate bread and fats.

***

Nigel checked his laptop. The battery was low. "I'm down to the wire. I just need a few hours."

"Don't worry, babe. I'll find you a spot." She put her hand in his. "I promise."

The sun already hung mid-afternoon when they found themselves trawling a dozen thin buildings joined by unpainted roads, searching in vain for somewhere to post up. Three hours on, the next village would be the same, and by then it would be dark. It wasn't until they had given up and were proceeding on their way that they found a low, white building, its windows boarded up with whitewashed plywood. Red neon glowed *open* above the white-handled door. The river spread lazy down the hill out back.

"It's open!" she said.

***

Nigel's contracted pupils caught a brief outline of scattered chairs in the shaft of light they brought with them. When the door swung shut behind them, their dilating perception drifted through the dim room to the bar.

"Who's there? I mean---hello," a man said, and stood up from his stool. The length of the bar was covered with papers, tools, assorted scrap.

"Are you open?" Alisha asked, stepping forward.

"Open! Of course I'm open!" Despite his affronted posture, Nigel recognized the rasp of a voice unused to talking.

"My name's Ray. Don't get too many visitors around here. What's your name? What can I get for you?"

"I'm Alisha. This is Nigel. He needs to do some computer work. It'll only take a few hours. Do you have wireless internet here?"

"Do I---?" He paused in his efforts to sweep together papers and what looked like a disassembled motor. He stared at her. "Do I have---? Of course I do!"

Behind the plywood bar hung a shelf that held a half-dozen glasses and a bottle of Jameson. Ray disappeared through a door and returned immediately, hands filled with still more papers. He was heavier than Nigel, powerfully built and taller than them both. His grey hair was gathered in a ponytail and his skin was pockmarked. He moved with vigour, unrestrained by the paunch that had slipped into the second half of his life.

Nigel sat at the far end of the line of stools, his back to the view. He took out his laptop and plugged it into an extension cord that lay thick and orange across the floor.

"Now what can I get you? You're on a drive?" Ray looked from Nigel to Alisha. His evident interest softened an otherwise intimidating stature. "Not a drive, I mean a---whaddyacallem, road trip?"

"I just need to make sure that I can get online."

"Oh---" His attention returned to the sheaf in his hand. He produced a small paper calendar, pictures of cats and dogs for each month. In September two years back, he had written a string of characters that Nigel entered into his terminal.

"Okay," he said to Alisha, who was draped over his shoulders. She watched the screen with fascination. He showed her a document with comments in the margins. "I just need to go through my editor's comments, fix all the issues, then send it back."

"What does that one say?"

"That one says 'faith' needs a gloss. A few words to explain what it means."

"Faith? I thought it was a review of a book about communism."

"Faith is the main question of religion, and for many post-Hegelians, it's also the main question of human existence. The same goes for Marx, much to the chagrin of the scientific socialists. He just framed the question in very different terms. God, who is infinite, takes on some form in the world, which is finite. The infinite coming into being within the finite is a logical absurdity, in a technical sense. Rational arguments for the existence of God, even 'belief' itself, are all beside the point. For Kierkegaard, the challenge of existence is to reconcile oneself with the impossible. That's what faith means: belief in the impossible."

"What can I get you?" Ray was not about to leave them alone.

"We'll take two beers." Alisha said. After he took two bottles of ale from the mini-fridge and set them next to a large monkey-wrench, she detached herself from Nigel and sat at the other end of the bar.

"Where are you headed?" He wanted to address both of them, and overcame the challenge of their arrangement by raising his voice in the quiet room.

"The north ferry?" Ray was surprised. "It's dangerous up there. There's no-one around. Cold. Better have extra batteries for your radio. What---no radio? You don't even have a proper spare?" He seemed worried now.

She was perched on her stool with her back arched. Ray stood behind the bar. Nigel glanced back at his screen. She crossed one leg over the other and didn't look at him. Her foot pointed, bounced. She touched her hair. Nigel took a pull from his bottle.

"I was born out on that island," Ray said. Sliding doors opened onto a shaded patch of flat grass. The only light in the room came dim through the glass. Nigel could see the first in a series of steps cut into the steep declension that led down to the forested riverbank. The water swept up blue and peach gold, framed by the doors. The thin line of the far shore cut the river from the sky. A narrow brown smudge stuck out against the pastel water.

"There are houses out there?" Nigel had first seen the brown smudge as a reflection of light; he tried to see it now as land.

"Houses? Yes, about...five houses! The one I was born in is still standing. Last one. Ruined. They're all dead. Just me and mum left."

Nigel closed the last of the document's comment and added another set of the initials "NC" to the sequence at the end of the filename. He sent it to his editor with a single short sentence in the body of the email.

"It's getting late," he said, standing next to Alisha. "Now that I have a charge, we could watch a movie."

"Yeah!"

"Go down there," Ray said. He pointed to where the road led down towards the river. Nigel took a toke from the massive, loose joint he had lit. "There's a big plateau. No-one goes down there. I grew this myself. Let me show you."

"We can't," Nigel insisted.

***

She stopped the car in the middle of a wide field. The sky was enormous overhead, just beginning to darken. He put on *Casablanca* while she pushed the cushions into a headboard they could lean against. They ate Ryvita and yellow cheese while the sky sank into the river.

The weed had made him shy. He brushed his fingertips along the outline of her ribs; the tickle made her laugh, but he remained solemn. They lay on their sides, laptop forgotten. His shyness left him as he pressed into her. The sun would not set. Long grasses blew in an invisible wind. They pushed outwards against the inside of the SUV, against the roof, against the windows; pushed down into the cushions of their bed.

***

The earth itself is unfixed. Tectonic plates drift through the ocean, buoyed along by invisible currents. One plate comes near another. Over millions of years, the earth's understanding of what it must do grows, and force builds slowly into a collision. The globe is shrouded in tempest and strife. Storm clouds last eons. Plant species die out, animals teach their young to hide: but there is nowhere to hide from the lightning strikes, from the earthquakes and erupting volcanoes. By the end of this unstable era, when the quaking has subsided and the sun shines through again, the mantle of one land mass comes out on top of the other. Through arcane processes beyond the ken of man, the point of the spiral points to one peripheral zone of obduction: a distant island, there to throw up barren highlands and mournful mountain ranges of desolate pale-orange rock. A substance whose texture is unseen anywhere else on the surface of the earth. A substance so rich in iron that the only life that can propagate are certain purple-green plants, a species mutated of a seed dredged up from the ocean floor. They emerge from the crevice of stones split by their roots.

"The left pedal is for the brake, the right pedal is for the gas. This is your turning signal: use it every time you change lanes. That's the cruise control. Don't go over 90."

The stretches of highway were so long, the curves gentle and the traffic so sparse that he quickly grew confident behind the wheel. She would let him spend an hour or more driving while she reclined and consulted the map.

"We're coming up on the exit for the terminal. Slow down." They were on a straight stretch, no cars in either direction. The exit was on their left, a right angle through the grass meridian that split the highway in two directions. He pressed the brake.

"Slow down." They were up on the exit; he needed to turn the wheel. "Slow down!" The beige SUV drifted around the corner. He heard a distant screeching. He let the vehicle level out before he pumped the brakes. They came to a stop halfway in the ditch.

"You almost killed us!"

"What do you mean? We're fine."

"If this was a car, we would have rolled! Didn't you hear me say slow down?"

"I did slow down." He was calm: she was over-reacting.

"Get out!" He closed the door quietly while she slammed hers. The vehicle was tilted at an angle, only one of its tires touching concrete. She was panting, and he was surprised to see tears standing out on her cheeks.

"Look at that!" She gestured at the road behind them. He saw four long black streaks burned into the pavement. "You were skidding! Don't you know how dangerous that is?"

"It was an accident."

She was examining the car now. "Look at this!" She pointed at the rear passenger-side wheel. "We lost a hubcap, Nigel!"

"I see it, it's just down there." He trotted down the road. Silence rang in his ears. The ferry terminal stood out low against the grey sea. Departure was scheduled for an hour from now. When he returned with the metal disc in hand, she was squatted by the SUV's driver's-side flank, leaning her back against it. She was crying now.

"I got the hubcap. There's no damage we can't fix."

"That's not the point, Nigel. I tried to stop it, but you wouldn't listen. I warned you."

"I thought we were under control. Everything was fine."

"You weren't in control. We're in the ditch now."

***

Returning to the mainland did not take a full two hours. The *Qajaq W.* had no cabins, just an observation deck and a vending machine. There was only one other passenger vehicle, a black pickup truck with humongous tires. Icebergs floated by. He thought about how cold the water must be.

They disembarked in a coastal depression. Up above them towered the dark outline of an endless unknown forest; further up swam unearthly colours in a new sky they had never seen before.

"We're in it now," Alisha said.

Beneath the price of gas at the village station read a discrete warning: "next stop 500KM." The station was closed.

"Over half a tank---can we make it?" Nigel asked from the passenger seat.

"We could make it. Maybe, barely. Is it worth the risk? I'm not sure."

"Slow and steady." He put his hand on her shoulder, squeezed, put his hand on the back of her neck. "That's how we'll get through this." She looked at him; her brows uncreased, the line of her mouth pointed up in a bow. He saw his own uncertainty and fear reflected in her eye.

***

She drove to get the lay of the land. It didn't take long to become apparent: just a straight gravel road that continued on through uncultivated forest. Nigel was surprised to find that the landscape here threatened to overwhelm him. The bare rock hills, the hardy trees in all their variety held a deep terror for him. This place was lonely and cruel; it was vast and unknowable. His ablutions impressed no-one. She wanted to make a fire, to find a bower and line it with flowers; he felt the unhomeliness of the world pressing against the thin membrane that separated them from the night.

"Keep it at 60. These stones could puncture a tire easily. They could do worse than that. If we get a flat, the donut won't get us far. It could be a day, maybe longer, before someone passes us. Ray was right: we should have a radio. We should at least have a spare."

***

They were in an endless aisle of aspens, wild bushes growing at the top of long trunks. The sun filtered through at the same low angle where it hovered without moving all day long. They had pulled over to the side of the road, barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass. The black pickup with whom they had disembarked stopped to see if they were okay. There was no-one else out there, and therefore all stopped to make sure the other was okay. Nigel gave a thumbs-up and a wave from the backseat. She trembled beneath him, soft pants around her knees. All he could see of her face was a single red cheek framed by her dark hair, the other half pressed into the pillow. He watched a bead stand still for a moment before running down, couldn't tell if it was sweat or a tear. She cried out.

***

"What's that!" They had come up on the crest of a clearing in the forest. Nigel pumped the brakes, but they had already made their interruption. A hawk flew off over the trees. A fox ran into the forest, and a rabbit bounded in the other direction. The caribou came right up to them, indignant and stern. He trotted next to the SUV while the two sat frozen inside. They inched forward, Nigel's foot light to the pedal. They held their breath. He cantered around to the passenger side to examine Alisha more closely with his brown eye. Nigel saw that although the spirit huffed, he was not angry. He was only checking them out, and would allow them to continue on their way while he returned to the forest.

***

They were now distinctly in a hurry. It was a bright morning, sun hot. They had descended back into the lowlands, where the air was hot as summer approached nearer.

"We have to go for a swim," she insisted. "We have to jump in the river. I'm not ready to go back."

"Don't worry. It's not over yet. We'll find somewhere." He took her hand. "I promise."

Their unpaved path had become a four-lane highway. She drove down a long access road until they saw somewhere to stop. The water was clear blue, down a short embankment to a beach of jagged rocks. They stripped down to their underwear and clambered down barefoot. They gasped and sputtered in the ice-cold river.

"There's something I need to tell you," she said.

"I knew you would, when you're ready. Nothing you say can shake me. I'll never stop believing. Even if it's impossible."

He was standing up to his knees in the river, water streaming off his body. She sat on a stone and squinted at him. The sun was in her eye. He was just a sparkling silhouette.

"I feel young," he said.

"You are young."

"We're young," he said.
