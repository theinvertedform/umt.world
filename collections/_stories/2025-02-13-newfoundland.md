* Camping in the cemetery
* Driving by Peggy's Cove to the ferry
* Exploring the ferry (it's empty)

"What have we got?" he asked, opening the passenger door, stepping out into the damp chill, then re-entering the vehicle through the rear doors. The two seats in the back were folded down to create a flat surface, covered with an ocean of pillows and blankets. Their bags were stowed in the foot-well, pressed up against the front seats. She clambered over the backseat and met him there.

"Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly out there."

"Okay, okay, but no shoes in bed." He sat awkwardly, legs elevated, and kicked off his leather sneakers. She untied her canvas trainers and did the same.
