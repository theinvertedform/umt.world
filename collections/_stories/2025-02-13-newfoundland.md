* Camping by the sports centre
* Driving by the beach to the ferry
* Exploring the ferry (it's empty)
* Camping by the side of the road; nothing around; fucking; slow \& steady wins the race
* Pausing at the bar to send edits. Old-timer talks about his weed, the island out in the river that he was born on.
* Camping out in a wide field; *Casablanca*, Ryvita, cheese; fucking so vigorously the SUV moves
* Animal conference around the bend; a caribou trots next to the car
* Gros Morne, like the surface of Mars. Walking through an empty information centre, reading the information displays. Eating lobster, but it's small, still young: they're there too early.
* Ice bergs off the northern coast; the power dam, its Sovietesque mass; unpaved roads like in South America
* Final scene: swimming in the freezing river before returning to the city, to work, to life. "I feel young."

He is a writer, unsure if he loves her. She is a musician, uses the camera he gave her, and cheated on him a few months ago.

The white line dividing the two-lane road glowed in the light of the SUV's high-beams.

"I don't want to go too much further," he said.

"Why not?" her eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"Nigel, I had one glass of beer three hours ago."

"But look, we don't have to go further anyway. Take the next right here."

She turned the wheel, and they passed through the gates into an empty parking lot. They were on the grounds of a school, with an adjoining sporting complex big enough to serve the entire region.

"Are you sure?"

"Why not---it's Saturday tomorrow. We'll be gone early. Just pull over there, by those trees. It'll give us a bit of cover."

She turned the wheel again, and they rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers lining the soccer pitch to a copse of trees that marked the edge of the terrain.

"Does it seem level here? It's important that we sleep on level ground, otherwise the blood will pool and our hearts might rupture."

"Our hearts! I think we'll be okay. We'll be gone early, after all," she said, and turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped out into the damp chill, then re-entered the vehicle through the back doors. The two seats were folded down to create a flat surface piled high with pillows and blankets. Their bags were stowed in the foot-well, pressed up against the front seats. She clambered over the backseat and met him there.

"Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly out there."

"Okay, okay, but no shoes in bed." He sat awkwardly, legs elevated, and kicked off his leather sneakers. She untied her canvas trainers and did the same. The light from the front seat turned off automatically, but the light from the school was bright enough to illuminate the interior of the car.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We don't have much. A cucumber, some cheese, some bread and hummus. Sandwiches!"

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, a spoon to spread the hummus, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. There was nothing she could use as a cutting board, so she drew the knife through the dark green skin and pale white flesh, stopping the blade against her thumb.

"Here you are, m'lord," she said, handing him his sandwich. He had never tasted anything like it.

It was a foggy morning. The sun shone wet into their pile of blankets. Nigel lifted his head. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, studiously ignoring the large, beige SUV parked under the trees. It was just before seven.

"Alisha, I think it's time to get up," he mumbled, wiping his eyes.

She stretched, yawned, popped her joints before sitting up. She wore her brown yak wool sweater; he was wearing his black pullover hoodie; their limbs were sore from the makeshift bed, from long hours sitting behind the wheel; they stretched in the fog, and their young bodies were quickly restored.

Nigel took out a small green canvas satchel from the footwell where he was keeping his toiletries. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet a small washcloth with a splash of water from their bottle and scrubbed his face.

"It's important to wash the face when you're in hobo-mode," he said. "An unwashed face that's just woken up is very obvious. People can always tell. Washing your face goes a long way towards disguising your appearance."

"Oh," she said, "they must think I'm normal," and proceeded to scrub the sleep from her eyes with her own washcloth.

She resumed her place behind the wheel, she in the passenger seat. While they waited a moment for the engine to warm, he took out his notebook and a map.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's just over three hours, approximately, from Truro to North Sydney. That gives us some leeway, but not too much. We'll make a quick stop at the first cafe we see for our morning toilet. There's a beach about halfway where we can take a break."

He looked at her; she looked back at him with a pleasant smile on her face.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He had been enunciating it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable in order to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When he kissed her, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and aggressive; but when he took hold of her, she yielded with a sigh.

She drove them along the foggy two-lane road, winding and filled with traffic even this early. Occasionally the forest of pines would break and they could see through to the sea, but it wasn't until they stopped at the beach that they got to taste the salt-spray air. Everything was grey, but they could see the wooden houses on stilts. Their bright paint shone in the cloudbank that submerged the world. Smooth stones covered in moss, tangled netting and lobster traps. They continued on their way until they reached the ferry and joined the line of cars waiting to embark. The ferry was massive---as big as the *Titanic*, but they were only a dozen cars.

A man in an orange safety vest brought them to their parking spot, clustered together with the other passengers in the half-empty loading bay. She grabbed her bag, just a stiff rubber tube rolled at the top and buckled down, backpack straps sewn to one side. She locked the doors, and they stood on the deck as the ferry's engines took them out to sea. The chain separating them from the water was fifty feet, marking half the width of their vessel. Across the way a family stood, children suited in matching tweeds and parents gravely behind them.

"I think we're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?" she said, and brought her arms together for him to shield her against the cold wind.

They moved through the cafeteria, a frozen vestige of the 80s. Everything was from a different era. All the restaurants save one was closed: the generic cafeteria operated by the ferry company, selling reheated portions of food unpacked from a Sysco box. Pastries wrapped tightly in plastic, bright green salads piled lightly on Styrofoam plates. There were enough chairs on this deck to seat hundreds more people than the scant dozen that stood in line for their frozen French fries. They observed what the cafeteria had to offer without even a modicum of interest, knowing that the larder he carried in the canvas tote under his arm contained everything they could want.

They sat for a while in the seats arranged off to the side, across from a Chinese couple whose fleeces and hardshells looked brand new. She looked out over the water, land by now gone from sight, watching carefully to see if she could spot a whale. He continued to survey the dining deck and its occupants. The family they had seen before came into view, and joined the line at the cafeteria. The children, a boy and a girl, solemnly studied the menu.

"What should we do?" he asked. "Do you want to play chess?"

She turned her head towards him, a faraway look in her eyes, and didn't respond. He remembered that he had not seen her in two months, and had little idea about what she had been doing during that time.

"Do you want me to tell you a story?" he asked. When she didn't respond again, he gave up and fell into his own silence.

The couple across from them whispered into each other's ear while they sat, alternately looking at the dining deck, and out at the frigid Atlantic. They had left the fog behind with the land, and out at sea the sky was smeared with thick cloudbanks. The wind kept them moving; the sun pierced through as they raced across its surface. There was no land in sight, just grey chop.

The couple across from them had fallen silent. Alisha's head slowly descended until it lay on Nigel's shoulder; then, she started rubbing her head against his arm, leaving her scent marks on him, nuzzling deeper into his chest.

"I love you," she whispered, looking up at him. It took a moment, but a small smile eventually broke through the hard line of his mouth.

"Let's go explore."

***

All they found was an empty hotel, so big they could almost forget they were floating out at sea, but for the slow undulating rock of the deck. As they moved through the empty ballroom, they opened the closets, looked in every nook and cranny to see what they could find. All they found were cleaning supplies, boxes of individually-portioned peanut butter and jam. He added a few to their larder.

They passed along one soft-carpeted corridor, peering through portholes into estate cabins. They were all empty, identical; they entered into one. An entire luxury suite at their disposal.

"Does the water work?" she asked. He turned the faucet in the miniaturized tub, and hot water sprayed in a steady stream from the showerhead.

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two big, fluffy white numbers cradled in her arms. Their previous lapse into moodiness was entirely gone from her face. His movements were still weighed down, clung to by a wooden encumbrance. Was she now overcompensating, to bring him out of their momentary fall back into the world they had left behind?

"Come on, babe, let's take a shower." He glanced through the door of the bathroom, through the steam that issued forth, across the bed where they had left their bags, towards the door that led back into the corridor.

"We can't lock it." She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell. Two small moles stood out along the ribs under her left breast.

"Don't worry, babe, no-one's going to come." She peeled off her panties, jumped into the tub, and peeked around the curtain. "Come on, babe, it's warm in here," she said. It was when she peered at him half-hidden and used her small voice that he could not contain himself. He bared his teeth at her, growled, and pulled off his shirt.

It was early evening when they disembarked on the island.

"We're in it now," he said. They were past the spring equinox: days were getting longer, but they had no more than an hour of light left.

"Are you scared?"

"We don't know where we're going, and we don't have much light left. We're low on food. It seems cold out here. We don't know the terrain. I'm worried we're in over our head."

"It's okay. We're just going to drive a little bit, until we find somewhere nice and quiet to camp. Then maybe we can build a fire!" She ended with this exclamation, excited by the prospect, even if he knew it was too late and they wouldn't have the energy.

They drove through the village they had disembarked in. Low, prefab metal houses with yards studded the uneven hills; the dirt roads surged up and down and around bends. They didn't know where they were going, but knew that this was the main road: signs for Highway Number One oriented them in the one direction that remained open to them.

"Hey, look, there's a dep!" He pointed at a building that looked like the houses, except its front was faced with glass vitrines. They could see through Venetian blinds into a light-up interior. A neon "open" sign glowed over the door. She pulled the car up to the porch, its construction of wooden planks ostentatious in the settlement built up entirely out of metal and other imported materials. Inside, the shelves were sparsely stocked with junk food and canned goods. Each item stood alone and resembled nothing more than a museum display.
