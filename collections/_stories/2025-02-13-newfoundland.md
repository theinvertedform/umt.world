The white line dividing the road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"I don't want to go much further," Nigel said.

"Why not?" Alisha's eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"I had one glass, and that was hours ago. Don't you trust me?"

"I do trust you---"

"I'm a good driver. My dad was a race car driver. He taught me how to roll. You don't have to worry."

"Let's go in there," he said, indicating the sign that cut off the semi-rural road.

"There? It's a school."

"Trust me."

She turned the wheel and brought them through a low gate. The school was a low building lit with a single spotlight; the oversized lot was built to host traffic to the adjoining sports complex.

"Are you sure?" In the headlights, they could see the aluminum outline of a pitch, the patch of forest darkness beyond.

"Tomorrow's Saturday, and we'll be gone early. We can take cover under those trees."

They rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers to where the terrain came to an end. She turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped into the damp night, then re-entered through the back doors. The two seats of the SUV were folded down to create a flat bed that they had piled high with pillows and blankets. Under the foot-well their bags were pressed up against the front seats. She clambered into the back and met him there.

"Are you still hungry, dear? Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly."

"No shoes in bed." He kicked off his leather sneakers, then he unlaced her canvas trainers and sat them in the driver's seat. She watched him in silent awe. The bulb above the rear-view mirror switched off, leaving the interior of the car cast in an elusive illumination from the distant spotlight.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We've got a cucumber, some cheese. I'll make us sandwiches, like we had on the farm. We had lots of cheese, but it was goat cheese. And we had lots of cucumbers, too, but they were always pickled. A pickle or some sauerkraut every day for almost an entire month. Then I had another pickle when I got to Berlin. It wasn't as good, but it was just from a stall at 4am."

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. She drew the blade through the vegetable's dark green skin, its pale white flesh, and stopped it against her thumb.

"With my compliments, sir," she said, handing him his portion.

"*Merci, mademoiselle*." A piece of cucumber fell onto his napkin as he bit into the bread. The fatty texture of hummus and cheese combined into an opulent texture, sparked with the watery acid of the vegetable.

"It was a bit reckless to go out for dinner without having somewhere to stay," he said.

"But I wanted to celebrate our reunion. We were apart for two months. I missed you. I wanted candlelight and wine."

"Nothing's going to come between us again."

***

The morning sun glowed somewhere behind a canopy of white fog. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, ignoring the beige SUV with the windows steamed out. The clock on the dash read just before seven.

"It's time to get up," he mumbled, pulling himself from the warmth they had breathed into their cocoon.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream," she said, blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep.

"I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around. He helped me take care of the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing."

His hand was on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him. "Can we get a goat?"

They stood by the flanks of the SUV in the wet grass and bent the stiffness from their limbs. Nigel took out a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet the square of fabric with a splash of water from their bottle, apply a few drops of soap and scrub his face.

"We wash our face in the morning to show respect for the world we are about to encounter."

"Oh," she said. "Like how we do it to please God." She began to wash the sleep from her own eyes.

He thought for a moment. "I never thought about it like that before. It's an ablution."

***

The engine block turned slowly, warming in its groove. His notebook had a page with a list of dates and locations.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's a bit over three hours from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time."

Alisha's looked at him, her eyes half-lidded. She was watching his mouth with a coy expression.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing. He took hold of her and she yielded with a sigh.

***

The *Leif Ericson* could hold many times more than the dozen cars that waited in queue. Two tractor-trailers were parked in a separate lane, each one pulling a double load of linked shipping containers. A man in an orange safety vest waved them to their parking spot.

Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side. Down its side ran a single welded seam. She gave the top a loose fold, clasped the buckle before swinging it onto her back and putting on her sunglasses.

"I am locking the car doors," she announced with solemn deliberation. The SUV honked when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. When she pulled her hand back out, he took it, kissed it, breathed onto her white fingers.

Vibrations from the engine came through through the soles of Nigel's shoes. They churned the sea to a huge expanse of white froth in their wake. The peninsula disappeared in a round wall of fog. Beams broke through the cloudbank.

"We're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?"

They were buoyed by a south wind blowing cold fresh life across the deck. Alisha turned away from the water, brought her arms together for him to keep her warm.

***

Along the perimeter of the common deck, empty blue vinyl seats were bolted in winged banks. Alisha looked out the porthole to the east. A crepuscular ray dappled her eye, a moment of illumination that Nigel saw pass over her in a flash before it fell upon him. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale." She was a silhouette whose edges sparkled.

"I thought about you every minute I was gone," she said.

"I held my breath the whole time you were away."

"Maybe you shouldn't have." Her gaze broke. "That's why I wanted to go alone. After everything that happened before I left, I wanted us to take time. I wanted both of us to be sure."

"I am sure. That's why I waited. Everything that happened---it wasn't a big deal. Not enough for me to leave."

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to put his arm around her.

"I never stopped thinking about you," she said, looking up at him before looking back out over the ocean.

***

They moved through a hatch along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door lay identical, pristine, empty cabins.

They entered one, locked the door behind them and deposited their bags by the bed. When he turned the faucet, hot water sprayed in a steady stream from the showerhead. "The water works."

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two of them cradled in her arms, big and white and fluffy. "Let's take a shower!"

He glanced through the door of the bathroom, through the steam that was already filling the tiny room, towards the hatch that connected to the corridor. She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell.

"Don't worry, babe, it's locked!" She jumped into the tub, peeked around the edge of the shower's plastic shell. "It's warm in here." When she peered at him half-hidden, he couldn't help himself. He bared his teeth, growled, and tore himself naked.

***

"We're in it now," he said when they disembarked. The days were getting longer after a long winter, but this one had already descended into evening. They were in unfamiliar terrain without a plan of where to go.

"Are you scared?"

"There's not much light left. We don't know where we're going."

"Let's build a fire!" The thought had not occurred to him. She made her home in the world: he merely lived in it. They took the highway heading north. On their second night, they parked in the hollow of a beach and there they built a fire.

The road swept in undulating curves around the perimeter of ancient cliffs, low stone hills waving with wet yellow grass. Looking west they saw nothing in the direction of the mainland. Now they were four days on the road. When they stopped for supplies, they marvelled at the price of the wilted vegetables that came from double-linked shipping containers. Most of what they ate were bread and fats.

***

Nigel opened his backpack, checked his laptop. The battery was low. "I'm down to the wire. I just need a few hours."

"Don't worry, babe. I'll find you a spot." She put her hand in his. "I promise."

The sun already hung mid-afternoon when they found themselves trawling a dozen thin buildings joined by unpainted roads, searching in vain for somewhere they could post up. Down the road three hours the next village would be the same, and by then it would be dark. It wasn't until they had given up and were proceeding on their way that they found a low, white building, its windows boarded up with whitewashed plywood. A red sign glowed *open* above the white-handled door. The river spread fat down the hill out back.

"Let's try it!" she said.

***

Nigel's contracted pupils caught a brief outline of scattered chairs in the shaft of light they brought with them. When the door swung shut, their dilating perception was pulled to the only source of light in the windowless room.

"Who's there? I mean---hello," a man said. He stood up from the corner of the bar nearest the door. The surface of the bar was covered with papers and assorted miscellanea.

"Are you open?" Alisha asked, stepping forward.

"Open! Of course I'm open!" Despite his affronted posture of perpetual receptivity, Nigel could recognize the rasp a voice unused to talking.

"My name's Ray. If the sign's on, I'm open. Don't get too many visitors around here. What's your name? What can I get for you?"

"I'm Alisha. This is Nigel. He needs to use the internet and do some computer work. It'll only take a few hours. Do you have wireless internet here?"

"Do I?" He paused in his efforts to sweep together the documents and tools and pieces of scrap. He stared at her. "Do I have---? Why, of course I do!"

Behind the plywood bar hung a shelf that held a half-dozen glasses and a half-empty bottle of Jameson. Underneath it was a mini-fridge. Ray disappeared through a door behind the bar and returned immediately with still more papers. He was heavier than Nigel, powerfully built and tall. His grey hair was gathered in a ponytail and his skin pockmarked. He moved with vigour, unrestrained by the paunch that had slipped into the second half of his life.

Nigel took his seat at the far end of the bar, took out his ThinkPad and the charging cable.

"Can I plug this in somewhere?"

"What's that?" Ray looked up, then came over to help. "A plug?" He yanked on a thin white extension cord until it stretched into range of Nigel's taught cable.

"Now what can I get you? You're on a drive?" Ray looked from Nigel to Alisha. His concern softened his intimidating stature. "Not a drive, I mean a---whaddyacallem, road trip?"

"I just need to make sure that I can get online."

"Oh, right." He produced a small paper calendar, pictures of cats and dogs for each month. In the month of September two years back, he had written a string of characters and digits that Nigel entered into the black terminal of his laptop.

"Okay," he said to Alisha, draped across his shoulder. She watched his screen with fascination. He showed her a document with comments in the margins. "I just need to go through my editor's comments, fix all the issues, then send it back."

"What does that one say?"

"That one says 'faith' needs a gloss. A few words to explain what it means."

"Faith? I thought it was a review of a book about communism."

"Faith is the main question of human existence. Communists tend to think they're above anything rooted in the individual, but it's time they get a reminder."

"What can I get you?" Ray asked.

"We'll take two beers, Ray." Alisha said. After Ray took two bottles of ale from the minifridge, she detached herself from Nigel and went down to the other end of the bar.

"Where are you headed?" he asked. Alisha tried to focus his attention, but he continued to address both of them.

She was perched on her stool with her back arched. Ray stood on the other side. Nigel glanced back at his screen. She crossed one leg over the other, pointed her foot coquettishly and touched her hair. She didn't look at him. Nigel took a pull from his bottle.

"The north ferry?" Ray was surprised. "It's dangerous up there. Cold. Better have extra batteries for your radio. Just one spare tire? What---no radio? You don't even have a real spare?"

*The question of faith is the central question of religion, and for Kierkegaard it is therefore the central question of human existence. The proposition is that God, an infinite being, takes on existence within a finite world. In logical terms, this is an _absurd_ proposition. Rational arguments and logical proofs for the existence of God miss the point: belief itself is out of the question. The point is to have faith.*

"I was born out on that island," Ray said. Sliding glass doors opened onto a patch of flat grass; Nigel could see the first in a series of steps cut into the steep declension that led down to the forested riverbank. The water swept up blue and peach gold, framed by the sliding doors. The thin black line of the far shore cut the river from the sky. In the middle distance, a narrow brown smudge stuck out against the pastel water.

"There are houses out there?" Nigel asked, incredulous.

"Houses? Yes, about...five houses! The one I was born in is still standing. Last one. The rest are ruined. They're all dead. Just me and mum left."

Nigel closed the last of the document's comment and added another set of the initials "NC" to the sequence at the end of the filename. He sent it to his editor with a single short paragraph in the body of the email.

"It's getting late," he said, standing next to Alisha. "Now that I have a charge, we could watch a movie."

"Okay!" she said.

"Go down there," Ray said. He pointed to where the road led down towards the river. Nigel took a toke from the joint he had lit. "There's a big plateau. No-one goes down there. I grew this myself. Let me show you."

"We couldn't," they insisted; said goodbye instead and drove down the hill. She stopped the car in the middle of a wide empty field. The sky was enormous overhead, just beginning to darken. He put on *Casablanca* while she pushed the cushions into a headboard they could lean against. They ate Ryvita and yellow cheese while the darkening sky sank into the river.

The weed had made him shy. He explored the outline of her hipbones without speaking. They lay on their sides, laptop discarded. His shyness left him as he pressed his body into her. The sun would not set. Long grasses blew in an invisible wind. They pushed outwards against the inside of the SUV, against the roof, against the windows; pushed down into the cushions of their bed.

***

Nothing in this world is fixed: not even the continents. They drift, buoyed along by invisible currents in the water and air. It's inevitable that one plate will collide with another. Gentle first, but over millions of years, these forces build. The collision shrouds the globe in tempest and strife. Storm clouds last eons. Plant species die out, animals teach their young to hide: but there is nowhere to hide from the lightning strikes, from the earthquakes and volcanoes erupting ash and molten lava. By the end of this unstable era, when the quaking has subsided and the sun shines through again, the mantle of one of these land masses comes out on top. Through arcane processes beyond the ken of man, the point of the spiral points to one peripheral zone of obduction: a distant island, there to throw up rolling highland fields and mournful mountain ranges of desolate pale-orange rock, whose texture is unseen anywhere else on the surface of the earth. The exposed mantle found here is so rich in iron that life cannot propagate, except for certain purple-green plants that look like a mutated species of a seed dredged up from the ocean floor. They emerge from the crevice of broken stones, as though their roots had split them.

"The left pedal is for the brake, the right pedal is for the gas. This is your turning signal: use it every time you change lanes. That's the cruise control. Don't go over 90."

The stretches of highway were so long, the curves gentle and the traffic so sparse that he quickly grew confident behind the wheel. She would let him spend an hour or more driving while she reclined and consulted the map.

"We're coming up on the exit for the terminal. Slow down." They were on a straight stretch, no cars in either direction. The exit was on their left, a right angle through the grass meridian that split the highway in two directions. He pressed the brake.

"Slow down." They were up to the exit; he needed to turn the wheel. "Slow down!" The beige SUV drifted around the corner. He heard a distant screeching, could make out a faint metal clattering. He waited for the car to level out before he pumped the brakes. They came to a stop halfway in the ditch.

"You almost killed us!"

"What do you mean? We're fine."

"If this was a car, we would have rolled over! Didn't you hear me say slow down?"

"I did slow down." He was calm. She was over-reacting.

"Get out!" He closed the door quietly while she slammed hers. The beige SUV was tilted at a dramatic angle, only one of its tires touching concrete. She was panting, and he was astonished to see tears standing out on her cheeks.

"Look at that!" She indicated the road behind them. He saw four long black streaks burned into the pavement. "You were skidding! Don't you know how dangerous that is?"

"It was an accident."

She was examining the car now. "Look at this!" She pointed at the rear passenger-side wheel. "We lost a hubcap, Nigel!"

"Don't worry, I see it, it's just down there." He trotted down the road. Silence rang in his ears. The ferry terminal stood out low against the grey sea. It was scheduled to depart an hour from now. When he returned with the metal disc in hand, she was squatted by the SUV's driver's-side flank, her back leaning against it. She was crying now.

"I tried to stop it, but you didn't listen. I told you and you just wouldn't listen."

"I thought I was in control. Everything was fine."

"You weren't in control. We're in the ditch now."

***

Returning to the mainland did not take a full two hours. The *Qajaq W.* had no cabins, just an observation deck with a few vending machines. They watched icebergs float by and he thought about how cold the water must be.

They disembarked in a coastal depression. Up above them rose the top of the forest silhouette; up above it swam unearthly colours in a new sky they had never seen before.

"We're in it now," Alisha said.

Beneath the price of gas at the village station read the discrete warning: "next stop 500KM." The station was closed.

"Over half a tank---can we make it?" Nigel asked from the passenger seat.

"We could make it. Maybe, barely. Is it worth it?" She was uncertain.

"Slow and steady." He put his hand on her shoulder, squeezed it, put his hand on the back of her neck. "That's how we'll get through this." She looked at him; her brows uncreased, the line of her mouth bent into a bow.

***

She started driving to get the lay of the land. It became immediately apparent: just a straight gravel road that continued on through uncultivated forest. Nigel was surprised to find that the landscape here threatened to overwhelm him. The exposed rockhills, the hardy trees in all their variety held a deep terror for him. The world was savage and lonely and cruel. Their loneliness was made more pronounced by the thin contrast of the gravel road. She wanted to make a fire, to find a bower and line it with flowers. He felt the unhomeliness of the world pressing against the thin membrane that separated them from the night.

"Put it on cruise control and keep it at 60. These stones could puncture a tire. They could do worse than that. Try to avoid any big ones. If we get a flat, the donut won't get us far."

***

They were in an endless aisle of aspens, wild bushes growing at the top of long trunks. The sun filtered through at the same low angle where it hovered without moving for fifteen straight hours. They had pulled over to the side of the road, barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass. The black pickup with whom they had disembarked stopped to see if they were okay. There was no-one else out there, and therefore all must help each other. Nigel gave them a thumbs-up and a wave from the backseat. She trembled beneath him, soft pants around her knees. All he could see of her face was a single red cheek framed by her dark hair, the other half pressed into the pillow. He watched a bead stand still for a moment before running down, unable to tell if it was sweat or tears. She cried out.

***

"What's that!" They had come up on the crest of a clearing in the forest. Nigel pumped the brakes, but they had already made their interruption. A hawk flew off over the trees. A fox ran into the forest, and a rabbit ran in the other direction. The caribou came up to them, indignant and stern. He trotted next to the SUV while the two sat frozen inside. Nigel kept them inching forward, his foot light to the pedal. They held their breath. It cantered around the SUV to examine Alisha more closely with its brown eye. Nigel saw that although the spirit huffed, he was not angry. He was only checking them out, and would allow them to continue on their way while he returned to the forest.

***

The had passed the zenith of their voyage, and the roads worsened the further south they moved. They were high up in the mountains. The only traffic they passed were construction vehicles, huge tractors or pickup trucks or other SUVs, grimy from the construction site. The dirt road went up and down and wound around hairpin bends. Nigel felt out of his element behind the wheel, with an unprotected drop on one side and cement trucks constantly roaring past on the other. He gripped the wheel tight but didn't wake Alisha. As he came around one bend, he had to turn the wheel quickly to give a semi-truck pulling a load of timber logs enough space to pass without crushing them. His heart skipped a beat.

Alisha woke as they were cresting a mountain. She lay back in her seat for a moment, blinking, before she raised herself to look out at the valley spread with forest out the window to her right. Dark green and pale yellow.

"Wait---what *is* that?" she asked.

"I have no idea. I've been watching it get closer for hours now. It's absolutely massive.

"It's our sign," he said. "It's our sign to keep building."

***

They were now distinctly hurrying. Only two days left before they were scheduled at work. Just before the cities started, they were looking around on a bright morning when the sun was hot, the air finally warm again.

"We have to go for a swim," she insisted. "We have to jump in the river."

They were on a conventional four-lane highway. Signs of civilization were still spread out, but they had unmistakeably returned to the straight world. She pulled off the highway; they drove down a long access road until they saw somewhere to stop. The water was clear here, down a short embankment to a beach of jagged rocks. They stripped down to their underwear, took their towels and clambered down to the water. It was freezing cold: cold enough to take the breath away. They both hissed and gasped and sputtered.

"There's something I have to tell you," she said.

"No matter how impossible it is, I'll never stop believing."

He was standing there, bracing in the wind and the sun, water streaming off his body. She sat on a stone and looked up at him, squinting.

"I feel young," he said.

"You are young."

"We're young," he said.
