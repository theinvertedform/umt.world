The white line dividing the two-lane road glowed in the light of their high-beams.

"We shouldn't go much further," he said.

"Why not?" Her eyes were focused on the road.

"Well---it's late, and you've been drinking."

"Nigel, I had one glass of beer, three hours ago."

"But look, we don't have to go further anyway. Take the next right here."

She turned the wheel and brought them through a low gate, into the empty parking lot of a public school. It was a low building with a huge lot that could host a game day's traffic to the adjoining sports complex.

"Are you sure?"

"Tomorrow's Saturday, and we'll be gone early. Just pull over there, by those trees. It'll give us a bit of cover."

She turned the wheel again, and they rode gingerly across the lawn, around the bleachers lining the soccer pitch to to where the darkness of a forest at night marked the edge of the terrain.

"Does it seem level here? We have sleep on level ground, Alisha, otherwise the blood will pool and our hearts might rupture."

"No! But I think we'll be okay. We'll be gone early, after all," she said, and turned off the ignition.

"What have we got to eat?" He opened the passenger door, stepped into the damp night, then re-entered the vehicle through the back doors. The two seats were folded down to create a flat bed piled high with pillows and blankets. Under the foot-well they kept their bags, pressed up against the front seats. She clambered into the back and met him there.

"Hey, keep that door closed! It's chilly."

"Okay, okay, but no shoes in bed." He sat awkwardly, legs elevated, and kicked off his leather sneakers. She unlaced her canvas trainers and did the same. The light above the rear-view mirror turned off automatically, but the light from the school was bright enough to illuminate the interior of the car.

"Now---" she pulled up the canvas tote they kept their food in. "We don't have much. A cucumber, some cheese, some bread and hummus. I'll make us sandwiches."

He took out a kitchen knife for her to cut the cucumber, a spoon to spread the hummus, along with two white napkins edged with blue embroidery that they used as plates. The knife cut through the dark green skin, the pale white flesh; she stopped the blade against her thumb.

"Here you are, sir," she said, handing him his portion.

"*Merci*, lady." A slice of cucumber fell onto his napkin as he bit into the bread. The fatty texture of the hummus combined with the cheese into an opulent texture, sparked with the watery acid of the cucumber. Both remarked that they had never tasted something so delicious.

The morning sun glowed somewhere behind a fog it was unable to pierce. Nigel lifted his head from their pile of blankets. A groundskeeper drove by in his cart, ignoring or not seeing the beige SUV parked under the trees wit the steamed-out windows. The analogue clock on the dash read just before seven.

"I think it's time to get up," Nigel mumbled, pulling himself from the warmth they had breathed under the cocoon of blankets.

She stretched, yawned, sat up and rolled her shoulders, joints popping.

"I had such a dream," she said, blankets pooled around her waist. Her hair was tousled, face lined with sleep. "I was back in Ukraine. Back on the farm on the side of the hill. You were there, and we had a baby. His legs didn't work. We didn't have a wheelchair for him, but he didn't need one. He would drag himself around. He helped me with the goats. He would reach up and touch the bottom of their little beards, and they would just go on chewing." He sat beside her, hand on her shoulder as she spoke. She looked up at him through long lashes. "Can we get a goat?"

They put on their shoes and stood along the flanks of the SUV. Her hair was held down under the mock neck of her yak-wool sweater. The hood of his black pullover sweatshirt was up, pushed back to frame his face and pin his hair in place. Together they saluted the sun, hands in the wet grass, and their young bodies were restored.

Nigel took out a small green canvas satchel from the footwell where he kept a frayed washcloth and a small bottle of Castille soap. Alisha, brushing her teeth, watched him as he wet a small washcloth with a splash of water from their bottle, apply a few drops of soap and scrub his face.

"We must always be careful to keep our faces clean while we're in hobo-mode," he said. "An unwashed face is very noticeable. They will always be able to tell us apart."

"Oh," she said. "I thought we did it to please God." She proceeded to wash the sleep from her eyes with her own washcloth.

He thought for a moment. "An ablution."

The cold metal in the engine block turned slowly in its groove. In his notebook, he had a page with a line for each date; the final line, two weeks from now, the date of their return was underlined.

"The ferry leaves at 11:45 am. It's a bit over three hours from Truro to North Sydney. We've got time to stop at the beach and take a break."

Alisha's eyes were fixed on him, but she didn't meet his eye. She was watching his mouth. There was a coy expression on her face.

"Say Truro again."

"Truro?" He enunciated it carefully, hitting each rhotic syllable to emphasize the word's internal consonance.

"The way your lips move---" she bared her teeth at him. "It's so cute---" and she stood up to straddle him. "Say it again," she whispered in his ear, and he said it again: *Tru-ro*. When she kissed him, he was delighted to find her mouth wet, tongue hard and probing. He took hold of her and she yielded with a sigh.

Spectral red and white lights glowed along the two-lane road that wound through the hills. On occasion, the forest of pines would break; the fog would roll aside and they could see through the low hills to the sea. Visibility was low, but streaks of bright paint on the wooden houses stood out in the thick atmosphere. No-one lived in the stilted shanties. When he looked more closely, Nigel saw that the paint peeled from the thin wooden planks under the constant onslaught of wind and moisture. The underside of the houses were hung with tangled netting and rickety traps, strings of buoys to mark the tide.

***

They were early to embark. She turned the engine off, and they stood out in the patch of grass. The *Leif Ericson* was massive, total overkill for the dozen cars waiting in queue. Two tractor-trailers waited in a separate lane, each one pulling a double load of linked shipping containers.

When the time came, a man in an orange safety vest brought them to their parking spot, clustered together with the other passengers in the half-empty loading bay. Alisha grabbed her bag, a stiff rubber tube with backpack straps sewn to one side. A single welded seam ran down the middle. She gave the top a loose fold, clasped the buckle before swinging it onto her back.

"I am locking the car doors," she announced with solemn deliberation. The SUV beeped when she pressed the button. "I am now putting the keys in my pocket," and she showed him where. When she removed the hand out of her pocket, he took it, kissed it, breathed onto her white fingers.

Blades the size of a man churned the sea to white froth in their wake. Vibrations from the engine came through through the soles of Nigel's shoes. The peninsula disappeared in the round wall of fog behind them. Nigel looked down its length to where a boy and a girl stood with their grave parents behind them. Together they watched the land recede. As the clouds thinned above, beams broke through the cloudbank.

"I think we're out here for seven hours," he said.

"They give us that long?" Buoyed by the south wind, they were surrounded by grey whitecaps. It blew cold across the deck. Alisha turned away from the water, brought her arms together for him to shield her against the wind.

***

The cafeteria sold bread wrapped in plastic, French fries tipped frozen from a plastic bag into the deep fryer. Along the perimeter of the foodcourt, banks of seats winged around the deck, ready for so many more than the scant dozens who buzzed with society.

They found seats across from a couple lounging in fleeces and hardshells, chattering in another language. Alisha looked out the porthole over the sea to the east. Another crepuscular ray broke through and dappled her eye, a moment of sparkling illumination that Nigel witnessed pass over her. "I'm looking to see if I can spot a whale."

"I never stopped thinking about you. Not an hour passed that I didn't think about you." Her eyes were dark under the pot lights.

"I waited for you."

"But---I wouldn't blame you if you hadn't, Nigel." Her gaze broke.

"It was just two months. Why wouldn't I wait?"

Alisha laid her head on Nigel's shoulder; she rubbed her head against him, leaving scent marks where she burrowed into his armpit. He had no choice but to stretch his arms over her.

"I'll never give up on us," she said, looking up at him.

"Let's go."

***

The liquor cabinets behind the bar were locked, but he kept looking through the cupboards. All they found were bottles of cleaning supplies, and a box of individually-portioned peanut butters and jams.

"We'll get something much better than that," she said, pointing her finger to the label on the box.

They moved through a hatch along a soft-carpeted corridor. Through each door lay identical, pristine, empty cabins.

When he turned the faucet, hot water sprayed in a steady stream from the showerhead. "The water works."

"They even left towels for us!" she said, bouncing through the doorway with two of them, big and white and fluffy towels cradled in her arms. Nigel's body was made out of wood. His limbs were heavy; the spirit of gravity sat on his heart. Movements were still weighed down, clung to by a wooden encumbrance. Was she now overcompensating, to bring him out of their momentary fall back into the world they had left behind?

"Come on, babe, let's take a shower." He glanced through the door of the bathroom, through the steam that issued forth, across the bed where they had left their bags, towards the door that led back into the corridor.

"We can't lock it." She was already undressing, discarding her clothes where they fell. Two small moles stood out along the ribs under her left breast.

"Don't worry, babe, no-one's going to come." She peeled off her clothes, jumped into the tub, and peeked around the plastic curtain shell. "Come on, babe, it's warm in here," she said. It was when she peered at him half-hidden and used her small voice that he could not contain himself. He bared his teeth at her, growled, and pulled off his shirt.

***

It was early evening when they disembarked on the island.

"We're in it now," he said. They were past the spring equinox: days were getting longer; dusk was already settling.

"Are you scared?"

"We don't have much light left, and we don't know the terrain."

"We can build a fire." She was excited by the prospect.

They drove through the village they had disembarked in. Prefab houses studded the uneven hills; the dirt roads surged up and down and around bends. Signs for Highway Number One brought them north. On their second night they camped on a hill and made a fire.

The road would sweep in undulating curves around the perimeter of cliffs; looking west they saw nothing in the direction of the mainland. Now they were four days on the road. Their bag of coffee was holding out. They marvelled at the price of the wilted vegetables that had come in on double-linked shipping containers. They opted for bread and fats and dark chocolate. "Even Angels Eat" [TK, Milton].

Nigel opened his backpack, checked the laptop there. The battery was low. "I've got to get it done today. Just two or three hours."

"We'll find you a spot." She put her hand on his tense chest. "I'll make sure of it."

They crawled through the next settlement. A dozen thin buildings were connected by regular roads; a few benches on a hill, built using state-approved form and materials. On the edge of town, a low, white building, its windows boarded up with whitewashed planks. The strip of gravel in front was empty. A red sign glowed *open* above the white-handled door. The river spread fat down the hill out back.

"What could this be?" Nigel asked.

"Let's try it!" she said.

***

Inside was dark. When they opened the door, Nigel's contracted pupils only caught the outlines of a few cheap tables waiting in the shadows for someone to come. Their dilating perception was pulled to the only light in the room.

"Who's there? Hello," a man said. He stood up from the pile of papers strewn around the surface of the bar where he sat.

"Are you open?" Alisha asked, stepping forward.

"Open! Of course I'm open!" The man was affronted. Nigel recognized the harsh voice that came with unused vocal cords.

"My name's Ray and if the sign's on, I'm open. Don't get too many visitors around here. What's your name? What can I get for you?"

"I'm Alisha, and this is Nigel. He needs to use the internet and do some computer work. It'll only take a few hours. Do you have wireless internet here?"

"Do I?" He paused from his efforts to order the documents and tools and pieces of scrap that had spread over most of the bar. He stared at her. "Do I have---? Why, of course I do!"

Behind the plywood bar Ray had hung a shelf that held a dozen glasses, a mini-fridge, a bottle of Jameson. He disappeared through a door behind the bar and returned immediately with another stack of papers. Ray was heavier than Nigel, taller than them both. His hair was gathered in a greasy ponytail; he moved with vigour, unrestrained by the paunch that had slipped into the second half of his life. There was nothing to it.

Nigel took his seat at the other end of the bar, took out his ThinkPad and charger.

"Can I plug this in somewhere?"

"What's that?" Ray barely looked up from his papers. Nigel bent over the bar, trying to see if there was an obvious plug somewhere.

Ray looked up from his papers, came over to help. "A plug?" He yanked on a thin white extension cord until it stretched into range of Nigel's taught cable.

"Now what can I get you? Are you just out on a drive?" Ray looked from Nigel to Alisha. His worry for them let Nigel see that the man would not be a threat, but as the man spoke he gained a new suspicion. "Not a drive, I mean a---whaddyacallem, road trip?"

"I just need to make sure that I can get online."

"Oh, yes!" Ray resumed rustling, until he pulled out a small paper calendar with pictures of cats and dogs for each month. In the month of September a few years back, Ray had written a string of characters and digits that Nigel entered into the terminal of his laptop.

"Okay," he said, glancing at Alisha, who leaned on his shoulder and watched his screen with fascination. He showed her a document with comments in the margins. "These are the comments from my editor. I just need to go through them and resolve them, then send it back."

"What does that one say?"

"That one says the concept of genealogy needs a gloss. A few words to explain what it means."

"Genealogy? Like, family trees?"

"Like family trees, but for values instead of people."

"Now what can I get you?" Ray said. He seemed worried about them.

"We'll take two beers, Ray." Alisha said. "I'll distract him," she whispered to Nigel. He would glance regretfully down the bar from time to time, where she sat and Ray stood at the gate leading behind the bar, then look back at his screen. She crossed one knee over the other, arched her ankle and touched her hair. He took a pull from the bottle. Ray continued to address both of them; Nigel could only do his best to ignore, while Alisha tried to contain him.

"I was born out on that island," he declared. Sliding doors opened onto plywood deck; a hill descended steeply to the forested riverbank. The river swept out pink and gold against the frame of the sliding glass doors. There was a tiny strip of land in the middle distance.

"There were houses out there?" Nigel asked, incredulous.

"Houses? Yes, about...five houses! The one I was born in is still standing. Last one. No-one lives there. Ruined. I think they're all dead."

Nigel closed the last comment, scrolled to the top of the document, and added another set of the initials "NC" to the string at the end of the filename. He sent it to his editor with a single line in the body of the email.

"Should we just call it for the day?" he asked her. "Now that I have a charge, we could watch a movie."

"Yeah!" she said, eyes glowing.

Before they left, Ray insisted that they smoke some of the weed that he was growing in his closet.

"If you're looking for somewhere to camp, just go down there." He pointed past his house, to where a path led down towards the river. Nigel took a huge toke from the massive joint. "No-one ever goes down there. You'll be alone all night."

They drove down the hill and she stopped in the car in the middle of the riverbed there. The sky was enormous overhead, settling into pink and peach streaks over the river. They could see the island Ray had grown up on. Nigel still could not believe it was big enough to consider inhabited: it looked like little more than a strip of dirt in the fat water. It was moving more quickly than it appeared.

They made sandwiches again, but instead of bread used Ryvita. He handed her a napkin to eat over.

"We're gonna get crums in bed," he said.

"No!" They laughed. "Crumbs!"

He put on *Casablanca*. All the films he had stored on his laptop were old; this one seemed most appropriate, and although slightly cliché, she had never seen it and didn't know. Afterwards they screwed vigorously, pushing outwards against the inside of the SUV. Pushing against the ceiling, against the walls, against the cushions they had used to form a bed.

***

They were in one of the most ancient and unique places in the world. Two tectonic plates collided over millions of years, the mantle of one of the land masses came out on top. The surface of the mantle was visible here, rolling fields and buttes of rock so rich in iron life was unable to propagate, except violet-green plants that looked like a species from the ocean floor, which emerged out of the crevice of broken, pale orange stone.

Alisha allowed Nigel to drive. "The left pedal is for the gas, the right pedal is for the brake. This is your signal: use it. That's the cruise control. Don't go over 90." The stretches of highway were so long, the curves gentle and the traffic so sparse that he became confident behind the wheel, and she would let him spend an hour or more driving.

She consulted the map. "We're coming up on the turn into the terminal. Slow down." They were on a straight stretch, no cars in either direction. An exit cut through the grass meridian separating the four lanes, where a road led off to the terminal. He pressed the brakes.

"Slow down, Nigel." They were up to the exit; he needed to turn the wheel. "Slow down!" The beige SUV skidded around the corner. He waited a moment, then pumped the brakes. They came to a stop halfway in the ditch.

"You almost killed us!"

"What do you mean? We're fine."

"If we had been in a smaller car, we would have flipped. Thank god this thing's so heavy."

***

The northern ferry was only three hours, and was half as big as the southern. There was no cafeteria, no cabin they could sneak into. They watched icebergs float by from the observation deck. The sun shone weak from a clear sky. Nigel had never seen this colour before.

They disembarked at the most far northern point of the mainland. Nothing but gravel roads from here on it.

"Now we're in it," Alisha said.

Highway 1 continued. It took them only a minute to reach the edge of the trailers scattered in community around the disembarkement zone. There were hours of light left, although Nigel couldn't be sure because of how far north they were.

They found the Red Robin gas station on the edge of town. It was also the grocery store. On the large sign, just under the painted price of gas, the sign read "Next gas 500KM." The station was closed.

"Should we continue?" Nigel asked from the passenger seat.

"We've got a bit over half a tank. We could probably make it, but it's not worth it."

"Slow and steady."

***

They found a hill to set up camp on. It looked out over a wild, unsymmetrical forest. Night came on quick and complete. They sat on basted cushions laid out in the dark grass.

"Are we going to see the northern lights?" she asked.

"I hope so."

After filling the SUV's tank with gasoline, she sat behind the wheel again. "I want to know what the road's like before I let you drive again," she said. The road was unpaved gravel, straight, surrounded by forest. "Okay, you can drive. Here, put it on cruise control and keep it at 60, no more. These stones could destroy the tires. We have a donut, but it's fragile. It might not last long enough to get us anywhere."
