Basic concept: follow a body through various phases. Narrative of a body in different atmospheric environments. Connection between past and present.

1. *Description, adjacent* Begin from a disembodied perspective. Contrast adjacent forms of the body, specifically the economic. Narrow in on the individual in the world. A form of disembodiment that comes from economic alienation. Atmosphere of regret and disconnect between one's history and present.

2. *Description, alongside* Another atmosphere of disembodiment, this time coming from social alienation. In the context of a classroom, where the man is taken out of his body. 

3. *Dialogue* Third atmosphere of disembodiment, this time sexual. Sex is as powerful a mode of embodiment as any other.

4. *Beyond Critique* Nothing is beyond critique, except for walking through the world. Palestine rally.

# Description, adjacent

Sometimes one is so drawn up in the pleasures of daily sensation that they fall into idyll; in these moments of blissful forgetfulness, the world will find the time to remind us of our facticity. The gaze of an all-seeing eye comes back around, and the imaginary present---an impossible moment that floats between past and future, is brought crashing back down into a concrete being. By some postlapsarian corollary, it is in virtue of one's past self that we are given the privilege of floating in the present of daily sensation.

In the course of a life, each of us will by means necessary sew an idol that comes to stand in for us. A second body representing the past, made up of legal relation, debt, scars, and whatever material we find in the course of a life. If we fail to repay those debts, it becomes the burdensome duty of the world to discipline us; pull us down from idyll by sticking pins through the stuffing of our joints. Bolts of pain come screaming out of the blue light. We are not just a body that lives in the pleasure of the Now, but we are attached to a history of facts. Weighed and measured on a Great Ledger somewhere in the sky. Or, on a computer disk...or in the memory of the one we want to hear from least. No bucket of water was ever so cold as the reminder of our economic body, dumped on the unsuspecting head of the one who presumes to forget. 

We might try to set fire to our paper-selves as though it were a pagan icon, but money is made out of plastic these days and doesn't burn easily. The idol is a tether to the past, but---let's be honest: who can claim to have changed? Aren't we still the same desperate one, scrabbling for survival, borrowing money without a plan for how to pay it back? She's still there, out of sight and by the power of forgetting, more and more out of mind. Yet she still walks the same earth as you.

*hello*

# Description, alongside

The blue light of the interface shines out from the dim orange glow behind the bar. A quiet moment at work, just long enough for him to check his messages and slip unexpectedly out of the present and into memory. This is why we are not allowed to check our phones at work. It defies the clock to connect to the outside. The clock extinguishes all life, a death that is a respite. The safety of an imposed identity. She's not even his dog anymore: the news shouldn't affect him, but instead, the corners of his eyes prick painfully. The bathroom stinks of piss, and it's too small to be safe. "I'm taking five." A brisk walk out of view becomes a panicked run around the block. Panting turns into hyperventilation. Heart pounding turns into heart racing.

"Are you okay?" A girl asks like it's her job. She keeps her distance from the guy sitting on the curb, face wet, wringing his hair like in a Caravaggio.

"I'm fine." It's the only thing he learned to say when he was being taught how to be a man. *No, I'm not okay, do you want to stop and talk about it for a really long time? I'm just dying to unload my pain on someone. How about a kiss? That would make me feel better. Want to be my girlfriend? I'm just dying to fall in love.* There is nothing more impersonally adjacent than the impassive contact between two souls peering at each other through a window in the Great Wall of Public Sociality.

"Thanks for asking," he adds. He couldn't ask this unless the whole thing were an act. She's not even his dog anymore. So what if she needs to get all her teeth pulled out because she has a genetic disease that they didn't catch when she was young. So what if he owes \$4000 to someone who is now a stranger. The guy on the curb doesn't get to make excuses, unless he is willing to sacrifice a pivotal aspect of his identity. A bucket of cold water dumped on his head, and the whole structure washes away.

Instead, he returns to the orange glow of the bar; retreats back into the safety of a false identity. After a drink and a few false starts, he manages to get it out to the other sensitive boys he works with. *It's us versus them.* Some French-from-France (FFF) fucker interrupts by standing entitledly by the door. We emerge like a platoon out of the back of the house, crawl over the top of the bar, and meet them in the no-man's-land of the dining room. He is first to fall under a storm of steely entitlement.

The adjacency of service is like an out-of-body experience. A car on autopilot: the technology is not all there, and it's only a matter of time before he crashes. At work, he is alongside his co-workers. We move our bodies in a precise, improvised choreography around each other. Little eye contact; jokes in passing; debriefs on problem clients; sharing the blessing of a good one: taking care of each other.

People take their bodies seriously, whether they know it or not. They take his body even more seriously than their own. Men change their stance on his approach, assume a defensive posture; often, they tend towards aggression. Women keep their masks up. He doesn't know how to see through them. They don't realize how little he cares. A golem, mask hanging with crooked carelessness. He doesn't have an identity here, other than "guy who brings you to your seat." *Move along, sir.* A different kind of institution, a different kind of spotlight, but just as mindful a Creditor as one could possibly imagine.

There is a bar between us all: a great bar in the sky. A membrane that marks the parasocial---but membranes permit passage. They can be punctured with a well-timed jab. In the rare moment that an errant personality chooses to puncture the routine of monotonous being, it brings him crashing back into his body---a warm, golden mist, rather than a rude bucket of cold water. The membrane suffuses the city. It permeates bars, cafes, classrooms; even the streets themselves are suffused with it. We are all of us immersed in the embryonic substance of the economic.

# Dialogue (that grows the personality of the encounter, not the individual)

The first mark of dialogue was her wave. Anyone can wave, but even from a block away, hers had extra significance. It rippled through the air, radiating alertness to its target. For the invisible one, this recognition is enough of a punctum to stand out. What clue allowed him to make that judgement? Was it her body language, the way she shifted on the curb towards him; or was it the history of prior waves leading up to that one fateful salute? What made that day's gesture land more heavily than the others? What made all the host of clues come together to form this particular set of meaning?

On his way in, he sees a girl sitting out front of the hairdresser's next door. They have met before; like everyone from the salon, she's a regular. She waves from a distance and he stops by.

"Remind me what your name is?"

"Milly," she says. "Emily-Rose, but everyone calls me Milly. And you're...David, right?"

"David?" he says, laughing. "Me, David? No, not a king, just one of his mighty men. Uriah."

"What's going to happen tonight?"

"Nothing special, I don't think."

"Maybe I'll stop by for a drink?"

She stops by for a drink. Sips from a shot glass of tequila at the end of the bar. He takes the opportunity to polish every fork in the house to keep the chat going. The others pick up the slack, but none of it matters, so he doesn't feel bad. No-one bothers him because, clearly, he's busy. They are with him in the joy of flirtation, the openness of possibility.

"Do you have Instagram?"

This is a crucial moment that has failed him before. Through the long experience of trial and error, he has uncovered the esoteric secret that *girls like Instagram*. The veil of sociality cuts the harshness of the blue light of the interface; it takes pressure off the individual by embedding communication into a network. *A place for friends.* It's easier because it's less personal. He prefers SMS in principle because it's an open protocol. No-one is incentivized to develop the SMS interface. The things that won't change are the most reliable.

"I don't, I never learned how to use it."

"How do you talk to people?"

"It's hard to make new friends. I have to ask them for their numbers directly. It's usually worth it. It makes things more special."

# Grammars of time

Life begins in the East, which is yellow, and autumn. Fall is the season of birth, symbolized in its death. Winter comes next, to the North, and it's blue-white, the most fearsome wind of them all. We must make it through the winter to reach the Spring, the West, red: the creative destruction of the Great Conflagration. South is summer, black as ash and hot night. Green sits in the middle, the basic palette that shades all the others.

All these shades that mark the passage of time have become dim in the modern era. Liberal democracy wants everything reduced to the blue light of the interface. Blue casts an unnatural shadow; the eye cannot make out distinctions, and everything is flattened. It is Their preferred colour because it's the one that They can control most easily. The world is become blue; the North Wind runs rampant across the face of the Earth, a destructive force that collapses everything in its path.

The pendulum swings; time passes; things change, but everything remains the same. The spiral tightens. Each new turn of the screw is more punishing than the last.

# Beyond Critique

The only time he ever called an MP was in 2021, when the Israeli bombardment of Palestine flared up to a new height and was again making international headlines. At the time, he was living in North Vancouver, but his primary residence was still listed as Montréal. He took the opportunity to call the representatives for both ridings; only the office of the Vancouverite called him back, presumably because his suburban constituency had less to worry about. An aide immediately launched into how Hamas started the conflict by bombarding the force-field that covers Israel with their glorified firecrackers.

This week, he called his member of parliament again. Called the office of Rachel Bendayan, the representative of Outremont. Said he wanted to talk to her about her stance on the current events in Palestine.

"Do you live in the riding?" the person on the phone asked me.

"Yes, I do," he responds.

"And you want to know what Ms. Bendayan's position on the conflict is?"

"I *know* what her position on the conflict is, because she has not lost time in making it clear. I want her to be accountable for supporting a genocidal, colonial regime."

"Okay, we'll call you back," the voice said before hanging up abruptly.

There has never been so great a temptation to virtue signal than this past week. Usually he is quite good about not indulging in purely symbolic political acts, but the blue light of the interface is so harsh it can print its own vision of the world onto the perceptual apparatus.

Of all the conflicts, all the wars, all the barbaric regimes, what makes him feel so strongly about this one? He knows little about it. Doesn't even know many of the details relevant to the present, because the one thing he is certain of is that the shadow-play coming through the interface is a false image of reality.

Is it some form of racism that makes him feel for the Palestinian people? A fetishistic over-compensation? Orientalism? Anti-Semitism? Displacement of energies from the local to the international, whose abstract stage is a way to avoid culpability for the local?

***

Arts and crafts were never his metier. He bought a foam board from the dollar store, roughly hacked it in half so the edge was ragged and frayed. Tried nailing it to a hollow metal broom stick, but that didn't work. Tying it at top and bottom with a piece of twine kept it in place. One side reads: *FREE PALESTINE*; the other, *ISRAEL = APARTHEID STATE*. The plan is to walk from the Mile End to Dorchester Square, where the rally is being held. When stepping out the door, hit with the reality of the world, the prospect of walking down Parc Ave (his usual route) and straight through the heart of the Hasidic neighbourhood feels too confrontational, so he takes St-Urbain instead.

Blue light is harsh on the eyes. It casts an unpleasant shadow-vision of the world that one is led to believe is a true representation of reality. This blue shadow-world is cut through by a jagged curl of barbed wire over whose top opposing sides emerge in combat. A never-ending trench warfare that plays out in the false reality of a shadow world. The blue light of the interface is another parasocial membrane---like the bar, the cafe, the classroom, the city street; but here we only look voyeuristically at the image of another. This harsh image of reality is not an accidental thing. It is a false reality that corporations and states are incentivized to create for themselves. An image of the world as poisonous as the blue light we perceive it by.

The rally is an antidote to this false image of reality. It's real. I meet a friend whose baby is strapped to her chest. She looks at me mutely, eyes wide open. I can't imagine how overstimulating this crowd of shouting, cheering, waving people festooned in all manner of colour must be to her. She doesn't comprehend, and therefore is unfazed by it, doesn't cry once. He makes eye contact with the baby for a moment, but then she passes on to the next blob of colour. Her pupils are dilated, it looks like she's tripping.

Nietzsche said that the Western subject has been dislocated from its roots. I felt this at the rally when a friend made me carry his Irish flag (he already had one in each hand). Several Palestinians hailed me for it, and I felt the allure of a root. A meaning beyond myself. Historical continuity. An identity beyond my role in the machinery of capitalism; beyond that flimsy one I have built for myself. The colour that stands out to me most in the Irish flag is the *orange*, perfect antagonist to our enemy blue.

A slogan coming out of the Cultural Revolution in China is that *it is right to rebel*. But it is not right for Israel to rebel against the sovereignty of Palestine. If we are looking for something that is "beyond critique" in the sense of impervious to it---something that cannot be criticized---then we can't grant this one without admitting to hypocrisy.

Lenin says that "it is not enough to take sides on the questions of political slogans; it is also necessary to take sides on the question of an armed uprising." The more-or-less consensus view in communist theory is that violence is necessary if you are going to do a revolution, because the enemies of the people are very happy themselves to deploy violence. If an oppressed group, such as a colonized people (or the proletariat) take up arms in their process of self-determination and you fail to support them in doing so, then you have taken a side against their self-determination. Writing from this arrogant perspective pumps me up, and for a moment I feel like I have landed somewhere beyond critique.

A pedantic counter-argument is that, under a dictatorship of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie become an oppressed group and we have no interest in granting them self-determination through any means. We need a dictatorship of the proletariat *yesterday*. There is a one-sidedness here that the bourgeoisie can criticize if they are willing to sacrifice their humanity and affirm their status as enemies of the people.

Is the principle of solidarity beyond critique? For Schopenhauer, compassion for other living creatures is the only sound principle in a life whose fundamental characteristic is suffering. Sounds nice, but unfortunately suffering comes in the form of political contingencies. I will not publicly express solidarity or compassion for Israel. How I feel on the matter of killing is a private affair. Here in public, to express sympathy for either individual Israelis or the state of Israel is equivalent to politically supporting the state of Israel, which I condemn in the strongest possible terms. This is a highly toxic situation for everyone, but it's the blue image of the world Israel has selected as representative of reality. It's not hard to imagine a situation in which we could criticize an expression of solidarity.

The only thing I can think of that is beyond critique is something contrary to what I understand as the ethos of this class (not to mention Marxism). It is also something that I am not sure how to philosophize, fixated as I am on the division between private and public. It is the sacredness of the Existing One. The individual. Yes, existentialism was my entry into philosophy, as it is with most boys; and I retain some element of that in my heart. My understanding of how we understand the world in this class is something like---a connected process of movement, where the past echoes through the present and is felt in the future. No-one is an island; we are each of us made by the environment, even if we all exceed our economic facticity, or whichever other environment interpellates us. Is this a ground where we can find the sacredness of the individual? Every individual is worth as much as any other; no individual is beyond redemption (?); no individual "I" can be reduced to the collective "We". It is only at the level of the individual that we can find a firm enough footing to stand beyond critique. Of course this leaves wide open the question of *what an individual is.*
