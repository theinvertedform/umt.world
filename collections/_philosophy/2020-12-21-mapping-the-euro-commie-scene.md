title: "Mapping the Euro Commie-scene: Interview with Ben Noys"
description: Editor of [Communization and its Discontents](https://www.akpress.org/communizationanditsdiscontents.html) [Benjamin Noys](https://chi.academia.edu/BenjaminNoys) joins Uriah for a discussion taking [Endnotes's critical appraisal](/assets/documents/what-are-we-to-do.pdf) of Tiqqun / The Invisible Committee as a starting point. We cover the political and cultural context in the UK, France and Italy, before getting into the differences between the anarchist and the Marxist tendencies of communization theory.
