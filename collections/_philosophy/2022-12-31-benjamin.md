One of the most popular German critics of the 20th century. Along with the Horkheimer and Adorno's writing on the culture industry, Benjamin's writing on mechanical reproduction are the two most popular conceptual innovations of the Frankfurt School. I would say, anecdotally, that Benjamin is the most popular member of that group, and he was never really a part of it.
