I first read the *Phenomenology of Spirit* in Winter 2020, in an online seminar led by Nathan Brown at the CEP. It was okay, but I didn't retain all that much.

From January--April 2023, I will use this page to compile my notes on the text, and on the lectures delivered by Dr. Angelova.

In the same semester, I will be re-reading *Capital* vol. 1 in a reading group with Erin Manning (hopefully this happens). My ambition is to use this time to write some kind of research project that can serve as an application for graduate school. This can serve as a backup, in the event that I don't get into an MFA for 2023; but it might also be useful at a later point, if I try to get into a higher-level philosophy program.
