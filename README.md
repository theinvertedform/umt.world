This is the repository for the umt.world hypertext project. It tracks changes to the text as well as the code. It was originally a fork of smithohj, a web design project for a friend. This one is far more complex, and is constantly evolving as I add styling and develop the website concept.

# Design Brief

1. Your Product

	umt.world is the personal publishing platform of Uriah Marc Todoroff. It functions as an index of work published elsewhere, alongside self-published work and miscellanea. The complete design project includes web design, as well as the design of the publishing process and marketing strategies. Opinion writing and a fictionalized diary construct an aesthetically-mediated, subjective portrait; the research represents the view of that portrait. The primary incentive to self-publish work in this form is to take advantage of hypertext design features that other publications do not; and also, to construct a comprehensive singular system. The website allows for extensive annotation, cross-referencing, and parallel commentary. We can use fragmentation while keeping it contained to one work. The goal is to create a system of knowledge that can be presented in novel ways, thanks to the possibilities of new media.

2. Your Objectives

	Our objective is to standardize and update the website's present design. Some of the new features that we want to create mock-ups of include: page styles for different types of content, margin notes and pop-ups. Additions to the website contents should also be more structured, so that we can develop a consistent marketing strategy. The website is a centralized canon: somewhere readers can go to find other works by me, alongside bonus context not available elsewhere. Over time, the website builds, my hope is that the original research will accrete a comprehensive and coherent worldview. Readers will be able to read original essays on the theory of art, move seamlessly into reviews that support theoretical positions, and along the way to be presented with a complete archive of citations and sources.
	
3. Desired Results \& Vision

	The website should appear as a vast, diverse, and complex set of writing, all of it interconnected, documented, logically structured, and designed in an aesthetically-pleasing way. The reader should be struck by how detailed the design is, how many features the website has, and how rich the text is. We want the reader to re-visit and constantly explore, and for all the content to feel of a piece. We also want there to be a constant, steady flow of updates, additions and revisions. This will be the content that supplies new marketing material. The writing should move between personal writing (diaries, reviews), story-telling, and academic-style research. All of these together present a fuller portrait than either could achieve alone. Readers should remember the website for its powerful, customizable, and highly-pleasing design; the original views on obscure topics; and the consistent, idiosyncratic voice that pervades everything.

4. Target Audience

	Unlike most personal websites, our audience is readers rather than other professionals. The main index presents everything non-hierarchically, not differentiating between professional bylines and self-published work. The website is a platform that people visit for its content; it therefore most prioritize usability (readability). The goal is to build my own audience, rather than strictly relying on the audiences of other publishing platforms. This means that we are conceptualizing a cross-platform marketing strategy, rather than simply a web design. That means posters, too.

5. Competition
	
	Some significant design concepts are taken from https://gwern.net, but that website author does not represent competition because we write about completely different things. The main competition will be attention and obscurity. In terms of the former, the complexity and detail of the design should be sufficient to immediately differentiate our website from others. Additionally, great attention must be paid to information architecture and the visual presentation of text, with enough dynamism in pages to turn complex and lengthy essays into approachable units---primarily through the use of sections and Tables of Contents, but also through the use of pull quotes and visual media used to break up text blocks. Additionally, there needs to be a more concerted marketing and branding effort. To do that, the publication schedule and content needs to be more systematically arranged.

6. Success Criteria

	The redesign will qualify as a success if we can: (1) clean and update the CSS files; (2) implement a more consistent production schedule; (3) begin marketing; (4) implement hypertext design features, specifically: responsive side-notes, responsive justified text, pop-up website previews, light/dark mode. The redesign will also qualify as a success if I can design the knowledge system and build script that encourages more regularized updates.

7. Project Voice

	The design of the website should be clearly rooted in the history of design, specifically manuscript culture and the Bauhaus. The design of the website should be ordered and professional (minimalist, greyscale, consistent), but should also have a few playful elements that do not detract from general usability. The scale, consistency, and pleasing nature of the design should seem incongruously expensive---it should blow all other author websites out of the water. Not only is the content itself far more ambitious and comprehensive, but the features of the website and its general usability are the result of a rare fusion of someone capable of writing, designing, and implementing.

8. Colour preferences

	Favourite colours: Purple, red, blue, off-black, off-white, light grey, dark grey.

	Least favourite colours: If the website is primarily greyscale with only a few coloured accents, purple and red might jump out too much.

9. Gauging Perception

	I like the logo of Gwern.net because the Gothic script harkens back to the history of print design that its author was influenced by. The logo is very easily identifiable, and can be reproduced in many other contexts. I want my logo to be rooted in history, but updated with a degree of playfulness that reflects my own playful personality.
